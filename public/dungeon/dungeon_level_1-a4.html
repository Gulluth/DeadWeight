<h1>Shattered Tomb of Acheron Zul</h1><div class="page undefined">
<p>You can download the map without the numbers <a href="dungeon/shattered_tomb_of_Acheron_Zul_1.png">here</a>.</p>
<p>Acheron Zul is long gone, but his horrible curse afflicted upon the nearby fief of Trinta. The <strong>adventurers</strong> must now enter his tomb to find his remains, but goblins have raided it first, finding things they weren't expecting.</p>
<section class="unlisted" id="general-information">
<h2 class="unlisted">General Information</h2>
<p>This is the tomb of a once powerful necromancer, called Acheron Zul, who died horribly during one of his rituals. Goblins raided this tomb to scavenge for magical artifacts but ended up waking up Acheron's curse. Now the goblins and the undead roam the chambers, fighting each other.</p>
<p>The dungeon has 3 levels. The mausoleum (this floor), the <a href="dungeon_level_2.html">burial chamber</a> and the <a href="">primordial cave</a>.</p>
<p>This adventure is planed to be played in more than one session, with the adventurers going back and forth from the dungeon and to the nearby village, to rest and restock.</p>
<section id="hook">
<h3>Hook</h3>
<p>Things were already bad at the fief of Trinta, and then the bad omens started happening. Milk turned sour, water became red, tasting iron and chalk, chickens started to eat one another and old people would cough small insects. The lord took action only when his youngest son fell ill.</p>
<p>The lord's soothsayer made it clear, Acheron Zul's curse befell upon the village, and a ritual must be conducted to purge them from that blight. Somebody must venture his tomb, and if there is still a mummy of Acheron Zul, or anything left of him, it must be meticulously fetched and brought to her.</p>
<p>Possible ideas for starting out:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>adventurers</strong> came to Trinta trough a trade caravan they were hired to guard.</li>
<li>The <strong>adventurers</strong> are under the command of the Lord of Trinta. Going in the tomb might be the safer than confronting him.</li>
<li>The caravans leaving the village are all halted because of the curse, the horses hoofs are all infected. Solving this might be the only way out.</li>
<li>The lord is suspicious to the to the adventurers, blaming them for the curse. Finding the corpse for the lord might be safer than trying to run.</li>
<li>There is a 100 silver coins bounty on the remains of Acheron Zul.</li>
</ul>

<section id="rumors">
<h3>Rumors</h3>
<p>Start by giving each <strong>adventurer</strong> knows a rumor. If an adventurer has 2 or more points in <strong>presence</strong>, they know 2 rumors. Do not repeat rumors between players, roll again on repeats. Ideally this should be passed as a note, so they can speculate between them.</p>

<h3>Dungeon History</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>This is some optional history for this dungeon, <strong>if you are in a hurry, feel free to skip this chapter</strong>.<br>
This information should not be shared directly with the players, this is a guide to the GM, so you will know what's actually going on in this tomb.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As well as being the feudal lord of the fief of Trita, Acheron Zul was a necromancer-priest almost a century ago. As most necromancers-priests of that time, he was desperately trying to stop the [dead vigil],{.tip}. While he started with a good intention, he quickly got obsessed and arranged macabre ceremonies and experiments.</p>
<p>His ever increasing demand for corpses would be satisfied by an old custom of Trinta, every month a sacrifice was made to <strong>Guhlat</strong>, a giant spider that lives on a nearby hill. The spider would leave the Trinta alone as long as she was fed live humans. The peasants would often capture and throw unwary travellers in the <a href="#15-sacrifice-pit">sacrificial pit</a> for that purpose.</p>
<p>Acheron Zul would then use those the corpses after the spider had sucked them dry, and eventually had a tomb-church built on the spider's hill. There he would perform many experiments, involving demons, undead, anf forgotten religions.</p>
<p>Digging always deeper they found the <strong>primordial cave</strong>, and an ancient temple of a forgotten god. Using the temple, Acheron Zul summoned the <strong>Vault Weavers</strong>, flying demonic spheres that would consume any corpses, leaving no traces behind. The problem was that the weavers presence was highly unnatural, and their feeding would cause terrible effects on Trinta, animals would die, food would spoil and people got horribly sick.</p>
<p>The people of Trinta, scarred, though that Acheron had cursed them. They invaded the tomb, killing Acheron Zul. His son was very young, but succeeded him. His first order was to give Acheron Zul's corpse to the weavers, seal the tomb and the cave. The curse eventually went alway as the <strong>Vault Weavers</strong> consumed all the corpses in their chamber and hibernated.</p>
<p>After many years, the curse returned after a group of expelled goblins stumbled upon the tomb and began living there. They accidentally awakened the weavers. The villagers are now sending mercenaries to the tomb, feeding the weavers even more.</p>
