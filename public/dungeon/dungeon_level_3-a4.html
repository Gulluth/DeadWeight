<h1>Shattered Tomb of Acheron Zul</h1><div class="page undefined">
<p class="alert">Still working on this level</p>
<section id="goblin-barricade">
<h2>Goblin Barricade</h2>
<p>A big barricade was built here made of spears, table legs, and other improvised materials. There's a hole in the barricade. Everything in this room is covered in a silky substance, similar to a spider web but with a different, fractal pattern.</p>
<p>1 <span class="m">vault weaver</span> is here, just finishing to absorb a corpse, trowing it's silk around the room. All movement inside the room is reduced by 3 tiles. The weaver will finish absorbing the corpse in one turn and become a <span class="m">red weaver</span>. As soon as it eats the corpse the <strong>adventurers</strong> feel a wave o nausea, and anxiety, as it was emanating from the orb.</p>
<p><strong>Killing the weaver will make it explode, trowing around all corpses it consumed before.</strong> This weaver have consumed at least 10 corpses, including the corpse of Acheron Zul, who can be recognized by the tattoo on his face.</p>
<p>Returning the corpse to <strong>Trinta</strong> will give the <strong>adventurers</strong> the bounty of 80 silver coins. The soothsayer will perform a very dramatic ritual in the middle of the city with the corpse. The soothsayer will claim that the curse is gone because of his ritual. And a small parade in the honor of the <strong>soothsayer</strong> will be held.</p>
<p>TODO: Lots of loot from the previous corpses if the adventurers manage to defeat the weavers.</p>

<h2>Weavers Chamber</h2>
<p>Behind the barricade is a big cave. Lots os empty clothes, coffins and loose pieces or armor are scattered around. A huge symbol is drawn on the ground. There's an altar in the middle with a low-relief carving in the shape of a body, empty.<br>
2 [tomb weavers] are here. These monsters are probably way too strong for the players to deal with, they should consider just sealing them there.</p>
