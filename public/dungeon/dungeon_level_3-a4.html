<h2>Goblin Barricade</h2>
<p>A big barricade was built here made of spears, table legs, and other improvised materials.<br>
1 <span class="m">vault weaver</span> is here, just finishing to absorb a corpse, trowing it's silk around the room. All movement inside the room is reduced by 3 tiles. The weaver will finish absorbing the corpse in one turn and become a <span class="m">red weaver</span>. As soon as it eats the corpse the <strong>adventurers</strong> feel a wave o nausea, and anxiety, as it was emanating from the orb.</p>

<section id="weavers-chamber">
<h2>Weavers Chamber</h2>
<p>2 [tomb weavers] are here. Lots os empty clothes, coffins and loose pieces or armor are scattered around. These monsters are probably way too strong for the players to deal with, they should consider just sealing them there.</p>
