<h1>Expedition</h1>
<p><img src="images/barbarian-torch.png" alt=""></p>
<p>During the <strong>expedition</strong> the characters venture into the depths of the earth in search of some reward. Raiding in caves and dungeons is not a healthy job, it takes a toll on the player characters. Time passes in a weird way down there, minutes turns into hours, and hunger and thirst are even deadlier than the monsters inside.</p>
<p>The <strong>expedition</strong> can be broken down in 3 phases:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#exploration">Exploration</a> when moving between rooms, looking for treasure and solving mysteries.</li>
<li><a href="#combat">Combat</a> when encountering enemies and resolving conflict.</li>
<li><a href="#camp">Camp</a> when resting and tending wounds.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>story</strong> will always be in one of those phases, during each phase the players can choose specific actions.</p>
<p>During the expedition it's useful to use a map with miniatures, ideally with each tile representing around 1.5m. This map should only include what's currently visible to the players.</p>
<section id="exploration">
<h2>Exploration</h2>
<p>During the exploration characters can move to another place in the dungeon, fix their equipment, interact with their environment and other various things, but every time a player attempts an action in the dungeon a turn passes. We measure that using <strong>exploration turns</strong>. Exploration turns are a valuable resource that the players must carefully use as a group, since every time a turn passes, some trackers will advance, usually causing problems for the <strong>adventurers</strong>.</p>
<p>Any action any player chooses will spend one or more turns. It doesn't matter which player does the action or if the action is done as a group, the turn is spent anyway. Players should avoid splitting up for that reason, if they are divided, they will spend much more turns. Turns during exploration are <strong>not only a measure of time</strong>, they measure the <strong>stress</strong>, <strong>fatigue</strong> and the <strong>general energy</strong> used by the characters. That's why if 2 or more characters decide to simultaneously do 2 actions, they would spend 2 turns.</p>
<section id="decay">
<h3>Decay</h3>
<p>The <strong>decay tracker</strong> is one of main the things that will keep the players from stalling in the expeditions. It's a tracker with <strong>6 steps</strong>. Every turn the <strong>decay tracker</strong> should advance, meaning that every 6 turns of exploration all player characters roll from the decay table. The <em>GM</em> may delay the <strong>decay</strong> tracker, if the situation is dire enough.</p>
<p>If the <strong>adventurers</strong> are in a safe place, outside of a dungeon and with no immediate danger or pressure the <em>GM</em> doesn't advance the tracker. A good practice is to only start the decay tracker when the <strong>adventurers</strong> enter the dungeon, tomb or whatever place they are raiding.</p>

<section id="omens-and-doom">
<h3>Omens and Doom</h3>
<p>The adventure should have a <strong>doom tracker</strong>, only the <strong>GM</strong> has access to it. The adventure should have a list of things that happen when the <strong>doom</strong> tracker reaches certain number, but they should always involve something bad. Raiding dungeons and abandoned places wakes up things better left untouched and reaching the maximum value of the doom tracker means certain death.</p>
<p>The <strong>doom tracker</strong> represents the <strong>adventurers</strong> meddling in the dungeon, making noise and awaking whatever lies inside. Advancing the doom tracker too much usually results in monsters appearing, rooms collapsing and traps being triggered. The last step on the doom tracker usually involves a very hard fight. The doom tracker is bound to a location, if the adventurers go to a new place, a new tracker should be started, if they re-visit a location, use that location's old tracker.</p>
<p>Every time the doom tracker reaches an effect, also advance the <strong>omens tracker</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>omens tracker</strong> is about the state of the party itself. The omens tracker has 2d6 steps, every time the omens tracker fills up, roll from the omens table and make a new one, rolling for the size again. Changing locations do not reset the omens tracker. If the party can't fulfill the omen effect completely, discard/break as many items as possible and <strong>one</strong> and only one more time.</p>

<h3>Exploration Actions</h3>
<section class="block" id="move-(1-turn)">
<h4 class="block">Move (1 turn)</h4>
<p>Move to a different location, usually to a different room in the dungeon. The <em>GM</em> can ask the players to spend more than one turn if the distances are big enough.<br>
Moving often lead to combat encounters.</p>
<p>While moving in the <strong>exploration phase</strong> the players don't need to worry about movement speed and may move their miniatures freely, as long it makes sense for the <em>GM</em> and to the other players.</p>
</section>
<section class="block" id="loot-(1-turn)">
<h4 class="block">Loot (1 turn)</h4>
<p>Looting a location does not require a test, the <em>GM</em> just lists what they find in that location and the <strong>adventurers</strong> can choose what to pick up. Looting can only be used on a safe location, with no enemies or traps. If the players want to try something riskier, it's a freeform action, and may require a test.</p>
<p>If the location has a trap, the <strong>adventurers</strong> may fall for it.</p>
</section>
<section class="block" id="parley-(1-turn)">
<h4 class="block">Parley (1 turn)</h4>
<p>When you find someone in the dungeon it's usually trouble, but players might try to defuse the situation with a more diplomatic approach. The <em>GM</em> play the role of the <em>NPCs</em> and the players should play the role of their characters.</p>
<p>If the things get heated the <em>GM</em> may require a <strong>presence</strong> test to keep the dialog from scaling to combat.</p>
<p>If trying to lie, deceive or fool someone, a <strong>presence</strong> test may be required.</p>
</section>
<section class="block" id="start-combat-(1-turn)">
<h4 class="block">Start Combat (1 turn) </h4>
<p>Most things in the dungeon want to kill the adventurers, a combat starts if the adventurers start attacking someone or if they are attacked by someone.</p>
<p>If the players have the upper hand and the other side is unaware of their presence, they don't need to roll the initiative test, and are all considered <em>fast</em> during this combat.</p>
<p>The whole combat only counts as one exploration turn.</p>
</section>
<section class="block break" id="catch-your-breath-(1-turn)">
<h4 class="block break">Catch your breath (1 turn) </h4>
<p>Like in combat, player can stop for a while and catch their breath, restoring up to one point of <strong>fatigue</strong> for each attribute. Players may also chose to use any items tagged as <em>quick</em> too, such as bandages, light torches and drink water.</p>
</section>
<section class="block" id="look-for-traps-(1-turn)">
<h4 class="block">Look for traps (1 turn)</h4>
<p>Looking for traps requires the <strong>infiltration</strong> skill, and explanation on how they look or at least some kind of tool, like a pole. The players may roll an <strong>intelligence</strong> test trying to find a trap. On a critical failure they will trigger any traps they find. On a great success they disarm it for free.</p>
<p>Finding a trap allows one player to try to disarm it, it requires a <strong>dexterity</strong> test, failing will trigger the trap.</p>
</section>
<section class="block" id="use-an-item-(1-turn)">
<h4 class="block">Use an item (1 turn)</h4>
<p>Any item that is tagged as <span class="tip">slow</span> can be used for 1 turn. Items tagged as <span class="tip">camp</span> cannot be used.</p>
</section>
<section class="block" id="cast-a-spell-or-prayer-(1-turn)">
<h4 class="block">Cast a spell or prayer (1 turn)</h4>
<p>Choose an available <strong>spell</strong> or <strong>prayer</strong> and perform the appropriate tests specified in the <strong>spell</strong> or <strong>prayer</strong> description.<br>
Execute that spell effect.</p>
<p>Even if the spell uses 2 actions in combat, it only uses one exploration turn.</p>
</section>
<section class="block" id="freeform-(1-or-more-turns)">
<h4 class="block">Freeform (1 or more turns)</h4>
<p>It allows the adventurers to do pretty much anything they want and require some improvisation of the <em>GM</em>. Freeform actions usually involve interacting with the ambient, creative thinking and solving puzzles.</p>
</section></section></div>
<div class="page ">

<section class="block" id="set-up-camp-(1-turn)">
<h4 class="block">Set up Camp (1 turn)</h4>
<p>Sooner or later the <strong>adventurers</strong> will need some proper rest, camping will allow them to recover some wounds and afflictions. <strong>Adventurers</strong> can only camp on safe places without any imminent danger.</p>
<p>Camping starts the <a href="#camp">camp</a> phase.</p>
<p>The whole camp phase counts as 1 exploration turn.</p>
</section>
<section class="block" id="take-a-free-action-(free)">
<h4 class="block">Take a free action (free)</h4>
<p>Some actions will not trigger a turn.</p>
<ul>
<li>Players may rearrange their adventurer's equipment, equipping and un-equipping items.</li>
<li>Adventurers may use any item tagged as <span class="tip">quick</span>.</li>
<li>Snuffing out torches or other equally simple action.</li>

<h2 class="big">Combat</h2>
<p>Fighting monstrous things in the dark is terribly costly and dangerous for the adventures. Ideally players should be afraid of fighting and try to avoid all the fights they can, but more often than not fighting can't be avoided.</p>
<p>The combat mode starts when a character attacks another. It is played in <strong>turns</strong>, the order of character is decided on the <strong>setup</strong> then the order remains the same, unless something changes during combat.</p>
<p>During combat the decay tracker should <strong>not</strong> be advanced.</p>
<p>The distinct phases of the combat happen on a loop, until the fight is resolved, they are:</p>

<h3>0. Setup</h3>
<p>The <em>GM</em> starts by placing all the visible enemies in the map.</p>
<p>Players must roll initiative, which is a simple <strong>dexterity check</strong>, adventurers that pass the test are now considered <em>fast</em> and will act before the enemy.

<p>Enemies also do not roll to hit, but instead players roll a <strong>check</strong> to dodge. This keeps the most combat decisions on the hands of the players. Check the <a href="#enemies-in-the-dark">enemies</a> section for more information on how enemies work.</p>

<section id="attack-notation">
<h3>Attack Notation</h3>
<p>When we write down an attack or weapon through this book we use an abbreviated notation, to keep things short and simple.<br>
All attacks specify a test that the <strong>player</strong> must roll, followed by the amount of damage that the attack causes and the critical damage. If the attack has any special rules those are written in full after the notation.</p>
<p>Let's see a simple example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Driftwood Club (STR 2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This one is pretty straightforward, to use a <em>driftwood club</em> the player must roll a <strong>strength</strong> test, on a success, it will be cause 2 wounds on the enemy, that can be reduced by any resistances the enemy has. Since it doesn't specify a range, it can only hit targets that are <strong>close</strong> (1 tile away, not diagonally).</p>
<p>Some weapons have special effects on a critical hit, let's see another example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Falchion (STR 3+1B)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To use it the player <strong>test strength</strong>(<strong>STR</strong>), causes 3 wounds on a regular success. The last thing is that "<strong>+1B</strong>", meaning that if the player roll a great success (rolling a couple of 6s) it will cause the bleeding affliction and one extra wound, to a total of <strong>4 wounds</strong>. To understand what all the letters mean, check the <strong>weapon effects table</strong> bellow.</p>
<p>Ranged weapons and attacks have the range specified in the description, if nothing is written, just assume it hits only targets that are <strong>Close</strong>. Here's a ranged weapon example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Throwing hatchet (DEX 1+1): Nearby</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meaning that a throwing hatchet can be thrown to any target within 5 tiles. At the <em>GM</em> discretion line of sight can be enforced and penalties for missing ranged weapons, like hitting other adventurers can also happen. Sometimes the range can be notated in <strong>tiles</strong> too, when a more exact measurement is needed.</p>
<p>Enemy attacks are also notated in the same way, but enemies do not roll dice to attack, since they don't have attributes, this means that the attribute on enemy attacks is for <strong>defending</strong> that attack. Again, it's easier to explain with an example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Soul nibble (INT 2): Ignore shields. Add a stun token on hit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an interesting one, to defend from this attack the <strong>player</strong> must test <strong>intelligence</strong>. If the test <strong>fails</strong>, the <strong>player</strong> takes 2 wounds. Looking at the description you can see that the player cannot use <span class="tip">shield tokens</span> for defending this attack and if the <strong>adventurer</strong> gets hit, a <span class="tip">stun token</span> should be added.</p>
<p>Some enemies or weapons can add <span class="tip">advantage</span> or <span class="tip">disadvantage</span> to the <strong>player</strong>'s roll. Those are done by simply adding a plus(+) or minus(-) sign before the notated attribute. And for a last example, let's check en enemy attack with critical hits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rend(-STR 2+2B)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case, a player must roll a <strong>strength</strong> test with <span class="tip">disadvantage</span> to defend from this attack. Enemies trigger critical hits when the <strong>player</strong> critically fails (rolling a fail with one or more 1s). So if a <strong>player</strong> critically fails a <strong>strength</strong> test against this attack, the <strong>adventurer</strong> would take 4 wounds and the bleeding affliction.</p>
<p>There are a few possible effects associated with weapons, so here is a list of all of them:</p>
<table>

<h3 class="draft unlisted">Ambush!</h3>
<p>Camping in a dungeon is always risky. After resolving the actions the <em>GM</em> should make an ambush roll. To create a dice poll you should add:</p>
<ul>
<li>One dice if the place is particularly exposed.</li>
<li>One dice if a fire was lit.</li>
<li>One dice if the party has camped before in this expedition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other things can add more dice, like the <strong>sleep</strong> action or events in the <strong>doom tracker</strong>. Removing dice is also possible, like the <strong>keep a lookout</strong> action.</p>
<p>Roll all those dice, if a <strong>6</strong> is rolled a combat happens, if more than one <strong>6</strong> is rolled, the <strong>adventurers</strong> are surprised. Use the <strong>wandering monsters</strong> from the dungeon.</p>

<section id="interlude">
<h1>Interlude</h1>
<p class="alert">The interlude rules are still untested, some balancing may be needed.</p>
<p>Interlude is the time between expeditions, it's when the characters rest, tend their wounds and plan their next job. Most <strong>adventurers</strong> do no want to  raid tombs and the horrible places they do, they have no other choice. While resting on the interlude the <strong>adventurers</strong> are actually draining their resources, <strong>Blacksalt</strong> is not a cheap place to live. Also be aware that characters can <strong>die</strong> during the interlude, specially if they are lacking of resources.</p>
<p>Playing the interlude depends on how much detail you and your group wants, you can play it <strong>unabridged</strong> or <strong>abridged</strong> or even mix both methods and choose what you like from each. If you are unsure, I would recommend trying the <strong>abridged</strong> first, since it's much faster, if you feel it's too simple, try the unabridged next time or even roll back and replay that interlude unabridged.</p>
<section id="unabridged-interlude">
<h2>Unabridged Interlude</h2>
<p>The focus os <strong>Dead Weight</strong> is the expedition, but a lot of cool things may happen during the interlude. Playing it unabridged allows new stories to unfold and character development.</p>
<p>Some rules change while not on an expedition:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no <em>decay tracker</em>, but the <strong>omens</strong> and <strong>doom tracker</strong> are still there.</li>
<li>The party doesn't need to act as a group anymore and may act independently.</li>
<li>Every day the <strong>adventurers</strong> must consume one <em>ration</em> each, or get the <strong>hungry</strong> and <strong>parched</strong> affliction. If they already have the hungry affliction roll from the <a href="#exploration">decay table</a>.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="abridged-interlude">
<h2>Abridged Interlude</h2>
<p>The time in the interlude is no longer measured in <em>turns</em>, but in <strong>days</strong> and <strong>weeks</strong>. The adventurers may spend as many days as they want in the interlude, as long as they have the resources to spend.</p>
<p>Every day has the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blacksalt events</li>
<li>Player actions</li>
<li>Hunger Bites</li>
<li>Sleep</li>
</ul>
<p>Expeditions counts as a whole day, so when returning from one, skip to the <strong>sleep phase</strong> immediately.</p>
<section id="settlement-size">
<h3>Settlement Size</h3>
<p>Settlements are places where the adventurers can rest for a few days, tend their wounds and restock before going back the another expedition. Different settlement sizes have different advantages and disadvantages, for example smaller settlements usually have less street violence, but are more exposed to external threats.</p>
<p>The sizes are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Small Camp</strong>: A small encampment with just a few people stationed.</li>
<li><strong>Hamlet</strong>: A few houses, usually with no official government.</li>
<li><strong>Fief</strong>: A small village, some farms and a small castle.</li>
<li><strong>Village</strong>: A village, with a decent commercial center.</li>
<li><strong>City</strong>: A large settlement, with lots of commerce and crime.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="1.-interlude-actions">
<h3>1. Interlude actions</h3>
<p>Just like the <em>exploration phase</em> the interlude has a list of <strong>actions</strong> that the <strong>adventurers</strong> can take. Each day the characters may do <strong>1 action</strong>. Actions may have different effects depending on the settlement size. The players should all announce their actions first, then they get resolved in any order, but players can't change their actions after they announced it. Players are encouraged to discuss and plan their actions.</p>
<p>Specific settlements will have extra actions that the players can also choose.</p>
<section class="block" id="rest">
<h4 class="block">Rest</h4>
<p>Take some time off to blow some steam and rest. Recover 1 fatigue to each attribute.</p>
<p>You may chose an additional effect:</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Spend 1 silver</strong>(size 3-5): Get get very drunk, remove <strong>terrified</strong> and <strong>hopeless</strong>, recover all <strong>presence</strong> wounds. On a 2d! you get <strong>nauseated</strong>.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section class="block" id="sell">
<h4 class="block">Sell</h4>
<p>Getting people to buy things is very hard in Trinta, specially in small settlements. When selling something make a <strong>perception test</strong> if you fail, downgrade the rarity of that item for this transaction, then roll it's value.</p>
</section>
<section class="block" id="go-shopping">
<h4 class="block">Go shopping</h4>
<p>You may buy as many items as you want when shopping. Different settlement sizes will have different items available, to determine if an item is available usually involves rolling <a href="#risk-dice-1d">risk dice</a>. For simplicity, the <em>GM</em> may just say an item is available or not, without rolling any dice.</p>
<p>When buying an item, the price must be rolled. That item price should be noted somewhere, and that item will have that price for all characters until the next interlude. For simplicity the <em>GM</em> may roll once for all common items, once for all uncommon items and so on. If the group don't want to roll for prices, the average price can be used instead.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Small Camp</strong>: Common (2d!), Uncommon(1d!), Valuable(unavailable), Rare(unavailable), Exotic(unavailable)</li>
<li><strong>Hamlet</strong>: Common (3d!), Uncommon(2d!), Valuable(1d!), Rare(unavailable), Exotic(unavailable)</li>

<h4 class="block">Lay low</h4>
<p>Adventurers usually call a lot of attention to themselves in the settlements of <strong>Blacksalt island</strong>. Laying low for a while may help to calm things down and redirect the attention to something else. Reduce <strong>this settlement's doom tracker</strong> by one.</p>

<h2>Character Progression</h2>
<p>Unlike most RPG systems the character progression is not always for the better. As the characters goes on adventures they can gain experience, gold and better equipment, but they can also lose their sanity, acquire grievous wounds, curses and mortal enemies. Characters can level up to level 6, after that they will eventually find their untimely death or will finally <em><strong>retire</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Retired characters contribute to <em><strong>The Guild</strong></em>, allowing players to start new characters with more bonuses and giving them a long term goal.</p>

<div class="page ">


<section id="enemies-in-the-dark">
<h1>Enemies in the Dark</h1>
<p>A list of monsters and enemies can be found in the <a href="bestiary.html">bestiary book</a>.</p>
<p>Enemies do not have a complete character sheet, instead they have a simplified one, let's look at an example:</p>
<div class="monster"><div class="monster-header"><p>Freshly Risen Corpse - LVL 3</p>
</div><div class="monster-attributes"><p>Wounds: 5, Armor: 1, Movement:5</p>
</div><p class="monster-special"></p><p></p><p>Ignores morale, never flees, never dodges. Immune to PRE attacks.</p>
<p></p><p></p><div class="monster-actions"><div class="monster-action"><p><b>Infectious bite</b>(STR 1+1): Causes <strong>Plagued</strong> on <strong>1d!</strong>.</p>
</div><div class="monster-action"><p><b>Lunge</b>(DEX 2, <strong>Nearby</strong>): Moves <strong>Close</strong> to the target and attack.</p>
</div></div><div class="monster-extract"><p><b>Tags:</b> undead</p><p><b>Extract:</b> Necro</p></div></div><p>Let's break it down. First the name of the enemy, <span class="m">Freshly Risen Corpse</span>, then it's level, this one is <strong>level 2</strong>. The level will help the <strong>GM</strong> to quickly know how powerful this monster is.</p>
<p>Next is the number of wounds this enemy can resist before being knocked out, 4 in this case. After that we can see how many armor points they have, just 1 here. And finally the enemy resistance, which is the value they will use for reducing any number of wounds they receive.</p>
<p>For tracking the enemy's armor and wounds, you can print this <a href="MonsterPage.pdf">enemy page</a> and fill them as you need it or just use tokens.</p>
<section id="enemy-attacks-and-actions">
<h2>Enemy attacks and actions</h2>
<p>Unlike player characters the enemies can't choose from a big pool of actions, they instead have all the actions listed in their sheet. Besides that, all monsters also have the following actions:</p>
<section class="block unlisted" id="move-(1-action)-1">
<h3 class="block unlisted">Move (1 action)</h3>
<p>Moves to another tile, the number of tiles that the enemy can move is written in the enemy sheet as the <strong>movement score</strong>. Cannot move diagonally.</p>
<p>After moving <strong>out</strong> of a tile adjacent to an <span class="tip">adventurer</span> the <strong>enemy</strong> must immediately stop the movement.</p>
</section>
<section class="block unlisted" id="recover-(1-action)-1">
<h3 class="block unlisted">Recover (1 action)</h3>
<p>Remove a <span class="tip">stun token</span> from this enemy. If the enemy has one or more <span class="tip">stun token</span> this is the only the enemy can take.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="other-actions">
<h2>Other actions</h2>
<p>In our example, the <span class="m">Freshly Risen Corpse</span> can only <strong>move</strong> or try the <strong>Infectious bite</strong> action. Let's review it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Infectious bite</strong> (STR 1+1): Causes <strong>Plagued</strong> on <strong>1d!</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The notation in front of the action means that this action is an <strong>attack</strong>, and it works almost exactly the same as a <a href="#weapon-notation">weapon notation</a>, the only difference is that the attribute listed is the attribute required to <strong>defend</strong> instead the attribute required to <strong>attack</strong>. If our <strong>Freshly Risen Corpse</strong> enemy tries to bite an adventurer this would require a <strong>strength</strong> test from the <strong>adventurer</strong> to avoid the attack. The enemies cause critical damage when the player character gets a critical failure on their defense. Enemy attacks usually have a special effect described too. Player's may always choose to no roll any dice to avoid fatigue, but that will cause the enemy to automatically hit.</p>
<p>Some enemy actions will cause a <span class="tip">disadvantage</span> to the attribute test related to them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Eat</strong> (-STR 3+3): Can only be used on a grabbed character.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That <strong>minus symbol</strong> before the attribute means that the <strong>player</strong>'s <strong>strength</strong> test will have <span class="tip">disadvantage</span> applied, allowing the <em>GM</em> to reroll one chosen dice from that roll.</p>
<p>If the <strong>adventurer</strong> has one or more <span class="tip">shield token</span> or <span class="tip">dodge token</span> they can spend them to reroll that many dice of their choosing. They can roll first and spend each token, one by one as needed.</p>
<p>Enemies don't have attributes so they can't make attribute tests, they make an <em>enemy test</em>, If an enemy needs to test for anything the <strong>GM</strong> can roll using the monster's <strong>LVL</strong> value, rolling the amount of dice. Although is recommended to avoid making tests  for enemies when possible. Enemies do not take fatigue.</p>
<p>Enemies also do not have <strong>afflictions</strong>, but some of them can bleed. If they are bleeding roll a d6 on the start of their turn, if they get a failure (1, 2 or 3) they take one wound. Only enemies tagged with <strong>living</strong> can bleed.</p>
<p>When enemies cause wounds to the <strong>adventurers</strong>, the player can decide where to place that wound, unless stated otherwise.</p>
<p>For more information on how fighting works, check the <a href="#combat">combat</a> section.</p>
</section>
<section id="taking-damage">
<h2>Taking damage</h2>
<p>When an enemy takes damage they will always resist wounds using their <strong>armor</strong>. Enemies armor can break and can't be repaired. Check <a href="#receiving-wounds">receiving wounds</a> for a full explanation on how <strong>armor</strong> works. After the rolling the <strong>armor test</strong> if the enemy has any <strong>resistance</strong> points, reduce the wound by that number.</p>
<p><strong>Armor</strong> and <strong>resistance</strong> can reduce the damage to 0, but anything less than 0 is ignored.</p>
