<h1>The Dead Vigil</h1>
<p>One of the most notable things about <strong>Blacksalt</strong> is the <strong>dead vigil</strong>. Any creature that dies in <strong>Blacksalt</strong> has a chance to come back to life as an undead, humans will almost always come back, animals and other smaller creatures can come back to life but that's not common. This effect is called the <strong>dead vigil</strong>.</p>
<p>The cause of the <strong>dead vigil</strong> is uncertain, some blame the old king for trying to achieve eternal life, others say its because of something buried deep into the island tunnels, but no one knows for sure.</p>
<p>Any corpse if left undisturbed will come back to life after 1d6 weeks as a <span class="m">Freshly risen corpse</span> or <span class="m">Reanimated husk</span>, depending on the state of the conservation and will start looking for other people to attack. If the corpse is unsuitable it may come back as ghost, like a <span class="m">shadow</span>.</p>

<h2>Time in spell descriptions</h2>
<p>When a spell mention <strong>turns</strong> without specifying if it's an <strong>exploration turn</strong> or <strong>combat turn</strong> it means that the the context should be used. If that spell is cast during combat it will last that many <strong>combat turns</strong> if it's cast during exploration, it will last that many <strong>exploration turns</strong>.</p>
<p>When a spell has a duration that explicitly mentions <strong>exploration turns</strong> it can also be cast in combat, remember that the whole combat lasts only one exploration turn.</p>
<p>When rolling for duration, unless specified otherwise, the roll is made by the <strong>player</strong> as soon as the spell have been cast.</p>
