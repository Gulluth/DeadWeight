# The Dead Vigil
One of the most notable things about **Blacksalt** is the **dead vigil**. Any creature that dies in **Blacksalt** has a chance to come back to life as an undead, humans will almost always come back, animals and other smaller creatures can come back to life but that's not common. This effect is called the **dead vigil**.

The cause of the **dead vigil** is uncertain, some blame the old king for trying to achieve eternal life, others say its because of something buried deep into the island tunnels, but no one knows for sure.

Any corpse if left undisturbed will come back to life after 1d6 weeks as a [Freshly risen corpse]{.m} or [Reanimated husk]{.m}, depending on the state of the conservation and will start looking for other people to attack. If the corpse is unsuitable it may come back as ghost, like a [shadow]{.m}.

# Gods

## New Gods
The new gods are the gods that appeared after the origin of the new world, the world current one.

### Goshkalon {.big}
![](./images/god_of_laughter.png){.left}
**The God of Laughter**, Goshkadon is a quite controversial god. His influence is mostly perceived as benign, but he's worshiped by goblins, gnolls and other evil cults. His blessings are never straightforward, usually having some ironic humor to it, never really fixing any real problems, only numbing the symptoms and effects of them.

Often venerated at the sites of great tragedies, gathering followers among the desperate and hopeless. Worshiping **Goshkalon** gives its devotees so much bliss that some will pray so obsessively that often die from hunger, thirst, and exhaustion without even noticing it.
