# Welcome

**Dead Weight** takes place in a low-fantasy world, it's very grim and dark but doesn't take itself too seriously. But be advised that **Dead Weight** has some **horror** elements, and may not be suitable for everyone.

The player characters are no heroes; they are *dead weights*, outcasts and treasure hunters with little to lose. They delve deep into long forsaken places, attempting to save enough silver to leave *Blacksalt Island* for better days elsewhere.

This system has a strong **structure** to it, it's **roleplay light** and focus heavily on dungeon crawling. While exploring the catacombs and dungeons, the characters must struggle with not only the horrors lurking there, but also their fatigue, stress, and the gradual decay of the valuable resources they bring. **Roleplay light** doesn't mean there's no support for roleplaying, quite the contrary, just means that the game should fun even if your group doesn't like to roleplay a lot.

The goal of **Dead Weight** is to capture the classic feeling of dungeon crawling tabletop RPGs and board games. It is inspired by many others, borrowing a lot from Blades in the Dark, HeroQuest (the boardgame), Knave, The Black Hack and Torchbearer.

## Blacksalt Island {.unlisted .break}

![](images/weaver.png "a knight dying in a dungeon"){.left .web}

This game takes place in **Blacksalt Island**, and it's a dreadful place. A once-great kingdom, **Blacksalt Island** has been ruined by famine, war and plague long, long ago. When things were already dire, the [dead vigil]{.tip} started, no one knows exactly why, but every single human that dies in the island rises up as a hungry undead. The island was mostly abandoned for many years, but was recently rediscovered. Treasures and arcane relics found in the tombs sparked a "gold rush" of sorts, with people far and wide venturing there to earn some silver.

Now, the island is divided into dungeoneering guilds, each claiming rights to raid certain ruins. They allow adventurers to explore them and even assist them with supplies, as long as they receive a cut of any treasure found.

**Blacksalt island** is a big place, with multiple cities on the shore, hastily built for this exploration venture and a few villages on its core. Of the original inhabitants very little is left, but some fief and hamlets still date back to the time of the old kings.

The ruins are filled with the undead, and the newcomers seem to only add to their numbers. Humanoid creatures also live there, mostly hidden in the shadows and in the forests, like the [child stealing](#the-child-stealers) goblins and the grotesque gnolls.

Unlike many fantasy worlds your character is no hero. Quite on the contrary, you are someone at the end of their line. Maybe your days of glory are long gone and mostly likely they never came. In one way or another, you don't have much to lose - and that's what brings most people to **Blacksalt Island**.

You arrived in the island hoping to find something, maybe treasure, maybe some lost artifact, maybe a glorious death.

<pagebreak>

## What you will need  {.unlisted}

**Dead Weight** is designed with both online and offline play in mind. This rule book has links and a structure optimized for reading online and on mobile, so it's easily accessible to all players. This game is best played with 4 players but you can play with more or less depending on your play style. The system is also designed to be **roleplay light**, meaning it will be fun even without heavy roleplaying, but, if you group like to roleplay it also supports that, adding a whole new layer to the game.

For simplicity the rules are broken up in different books:
- [Core Rules](./index.html): This book, cover all the important rules and basic information on how to play and create characters.
- [Bestiary](./bestiary.html): A list of monsters and enemies for the **adventurers** and their respective stats and lore.
- [Blacksalt](./blacksalt.html): A lore guide about the island and the world of **Blacksalt**, gods, settlements and locations.
- [Sample Dungeon](./dungeon/dungeon_level_1.html): **Players should NOT read this**, only the **GM**. A sample dungeon for a first adventure.

If you never played a tabletop RPG before, check [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_v3vTAEML0) video, for a basic explanation. {.web}

**For online play you will need:**

- Some voice and text chatting software like [Discord](https://discord.com) or similar.
- A robust online dice rolling software that allows rerolling, like [Dead Dice](https://deaddice.page/) a dice rolling app I made just for this system, Dead Dice also automate the player's character sheet.
- A virtual tabletop, the simpler the better. I highly recommend [Owlbear Rodeo](https://www.owlbear.rodeo/). 
- A copy of the character sheet for each player, digital or printed, to the player preference.

**For playing offline you will need:**

- **You can get a print-optimized version of this page too. We provide in two formats [A4](index-a4.html) and [Letter](index-letter.html).** (work in progress) {.web}
- Pen and paper for everyone.
- A copy of the character sheet for each player, digital or printed, to the player preference.
- As many 6-sided dices as you can. Ideally 5 per player. Can be played with fewer dice, but it slows down the game, alternatively the players may use [Dead Dice](https://deaddice.page/) on their phones or tables for a [digital sheet]{.tip}.
- Coins, beans, anything that can be used as tokens. There are 3 types of tokens, **stun**, **shield** and **dodge**.
- Miniatures or some kind of pawns. Each player will require one and the GM will require some for the enemies. They should be easily identifiable.

# The Basics
Let's go over the basics of the system, after that I recommend that you try to create your first character.

### Game Master {.unlisted}
One of the players is the **game master**, in this book we will also abbreviate that to **GM**. The *GM* is like a narrator and plays with all the non-player characters, guides the outcomes of the player actions and creates the details of the world.

The game master has [game master sheet](DeadWeight-master-sheet.pdf), just like the players. {.draft}

### Players {.unlisted}
Every one else is considered a **player**. Players will each have a **character** they will roleplay, they will choose the actions of that character and try to keep them alive and to move towards that characters *objectives*.

### Adventurers {.unlisted}
**Characters** in **Dead Weight** are people who either lost everything or didn't ever had anything to begin with. Misfits adventurers willing to risk going into the deep vaults of the **Blacksalt Island** to find precious treasures and artifacts while risking their lives and their sanity. There are no heroes in **Blacksalt Island**.

Characters will *level up* between expeditions and eventually retire, if everything goes well. Characters can also find an untimely end by something horrible in the depths of the island.

In this book we will often say **adventurers** when referring specifically to player characters.

### Game Session {.unlisted}

This game played in **sessions**, that can last at least one hour and up to 4 hours, it depends on the play style of your group. Each game session is structured in 2 distinct states, the **expedition** and the **interlude**,  which is basically delving into a terrible place or recovering and making plans for the next expedition. The players may choose from a list of actions depending on which phase the game currently is. Depending on how much roleplay your group likes the interlude phase may be simplified or not.

### Ok, how do I start? {.unlisted}
First, decide who will be the **game master** and who are going to be the **players**, the game master should ideally read this whole rule book, including the **sample dungeon** in the end. It is recommended that the players read at least the [Core Mechanics](#core-mechanics) after creating the characters, but it's not required. Players should **not** ready the **sample dungeon** or they will spoil the adventure.

Then each player should create a **character**, follow the [Character Creation](#character-creation) chapter for more information.

::: {.draft}
The **GM** should also fill the [game master sheet](DeadWeight-master-sheet.pdf) to set the tone of the world.
In the end of this book there's a sample dungeon to help the **GM** get started. The **players** should **not** read that section.
:::

After that the adventure starts! It is recommended to start on the **expedition**, with the **adventurers** right outside the dungeon entrance, choosing how they will enter. If you want you can also start in a village, or city, that's entirely up to you.

# Character Creation

![](images/boat.png "A boat in a dark sea"){.left}

Let's start by creating your character, don't worry too much about the rule system for now, just follow the steps from this chapter and choose what you think sounds more exciting. If you really want to know the rules before doing this, you can skip ahead and come back after you learned the rules.

Every character starts their life with **1 insight point**. **Insight points** can be used to re-roll one or both dice of a life path roll, some life paths will give you more insight. When you complete the last step of your character, you can "move" one **attribute score point** from one of your **highest scores** to another for each insight point you have left. When playing with a group, if your character has the same **life path** as another character in your party, you may, only once, roll again without spending insight.

Each step will add and remove **attribute points**, **equipment**, and other things to your character. Place them in the appropriate place in your character sheet. 

If you get the same skill twice upgrade it instead. Feel free to jump ahead in to the [skills](#skills), [traits](#special-traits) and [equipment](./blacksalt.html#equipment) section to understand what they do.

Print a [character sheet](DeadWeight-sheet.pdf) or use [Dead Dice](https://deaddice.page/) if you want a digital sheet and let's start! Alternatively you can also try the [character generator](chargen.html) for an automatic character.

**Adventurers** have 4 main attributes, they are noted in the [character sheet](DeadWeight-sheet.pdf):

- **Strength**(STR) is physical strength and constitution of a character.
- **Dexterity**(DEX) is how fast and precise a character is.
- **Intelligence**(INT) is how intelligent, wise and keen a character is
- **Presence**(PRE) is how persuasive and strong-willed a character is.

Each attribute has 2 values, the **score** and the **proficiency**, the fist one is the natural ability and endurance with that attribute, the other one is how trained the **adventurer** is with that particular field. In the [character sheet](DeadWeight-sheet.pdf), the square area is for the **score** and the circle is for the **proficiency**.

All **attributes scores** start at 1, all **attribute proficiencies** starts at zero.

**Attributes scores** can **not** go lower than 0 or higher than 3 at any point of the character creation, ignore any excess points.

**Attribute proficiencies** can **not** go lower than 0 or higher than 2 at any point of the character creation, ignore any excess points.

You can choose a different conductor or grimoire, if the *GM* allows it.

#### Spells

Wizards must choose a number of **spells** equal to their **intelligence score** from the spell list from their school of magic, check the [Blacksalt book](./blacksalt.html#schools-of-magic) for that. Write them down in your character sheet under the "spells and prayers" section.

Wizards require a **conductor** to perform their spells, usually a wand, staff or crystal ball. Conductors help them to channel the magic from the *void plane* to the real world. While casting a spell without a conductor is possible, it's extremely dangerous. When casting without a conductor, any **failure** counts as a **critical failure**

Wizards also need a **grimoire** to store their spells, without their grimoire they can't study during the interlude or camping phase to remember forgotten spells. In some cases the grimoire and the conductor are the same.

When the expedition starts the player must choose a which spells the adventurer will have memorized. For each **intelligence** point, one spell can be memorized.

Casting a spell is always guaranteed to work, after the spell effects are resolved the **player** must do an **intelligence** test:

- On a **success** nothing else happens, the spell was cast as intended.
- On a **failure** the caster forgets the spell.
- On a **critical failure** roll from the spell mishap table. Keep track of how many mishaps happened during this expedition. Add that number to the dice.
- On a **great success** you tap into an arcane well. Your next spell will be an automatic success.

| 2d6 + Previous mishaps | Effect                                                                                                 |

|           14           | You see a giant eye looking at you. Get the **Doomed** affliction.                                     |

|           16           | A third eye opens in your forehead, you are now with the **Cursed** affliction.                        |

### Cleric {.big .break}

![](images/cleric-yulak.png "Cleric"){.left}

- Add 1 proficiency points to **Presence**.
- Add the trait **divine mandate**.
- Add skill **banish undead**.

Choose one of the following as your starting equipment:

  - **A:** Flail (STR 2X+2), forbidden scriptures (holy symbol), leather trench coat (1 [AP]{.tip}), 3d6 silver coins.
  - **B:** War hammer (STR 1P+3), Ancient talisman (holy symbol), Ud6 flasks of holy water, thick cloak (1 [AP]{.tip}), 3d6 silver coins.
  - **C:** Notched whip (DEX 1R+2B), torture equipment, rope, book of sins (holy symbol), tattered cloak, 1d6 coins.

Clerics must choose a god to follow, you can see the list of gods in the [Blacksalt book](./blacksalt.html#gods). Clerics must also choose a number of prayers equal to their **presence score** from the [basic prayers list](#prayers-list) or from their god's prayers. Write them down in your character sheet under the "spells and prayers" section.

#### Prayers
Clerics require a **holy symbol** to cast a prayer, that symbol depends on the god that the cleric follows. Casting a prayer without a holy symbol doesn't work, but they are usually easy to improvise.

When the expedition starts the player must choose a which prayers the adventurer will have memorized. For each **presence** point, one prayer can be memorized. Each prayer may only be used **once** until the adventurer **rests** at camp, once a prayer is used it is considered **exhausted**. Once per expedition, the cleric may do a **desperate plea** and use on exhausted prayer once.

Casting a prayer is not guaranteed to always work, since the gods can be cruel sometimes. Make a **presence test** when your adventurer tries to cast **prayer**:

- On a **success** the prayer is answered, resolve the effects as usual.
- On a **failure** the prayer is ignored, don't do anything. Ignored prayers do not exhaust them.
- On a **critical failure** you have angered your god, it won't answer any prayers until you make a **sacrifice**.
- On a **great success** you also receive a miracle, roll from the **miracle table**.

|  1d6  | Effect                                                                                                                                        |

# Core mechanics

## Game Structure
A game of **Dead Weight** runs a bit differently then most tabletop RPGs, it follows a strong structure, with two main states.

- [Expedition Phase](#expedition-phase)
- [Interlude](#interlude)

The game usually starts on the **Expedition Phase**, with the adventurers raiding a dungeon or some other terrible place in the **Blacksalt Isle**.

## Dice Notation
Like many tabletop RPGs, **Dead Weight** uses dice notation to specify when and how you should roll your dice. Most of dice roll are common six-sided dice, unless specified otherwise.

When you see **d4**, **d6**, **d8**, **d10**, **d12** and **d20** this is referring to a die of that size, d4 is a four-sized dice and d20 is a twenty-sided dice. 

### Adding dice (2d6) {.unlisted}
And when you see **3d6** means to roll **three six-sided dice** and add the result.

### Usage dice (Ud8) {.unlisted}
Usage dice is a weird but very useful concept. Usage dice are used for tracking how many consumables a character has, like **Trowing Daggers(Ud8)** has a usage dice of a d8. Every time the consumable is used the usage dice should be rolled, if the result is a 1 or 2, that dice is downgraded to the smallest die in the following chain:

**d20 > d12 > d10 > d8 > d6 > d4**

If you roll a 1 or 2 on a **d4** that item is gone, you just used the last one.

### Risk dice (1d!) {.unlisted}
Rolling a risk dice is usually for checking when if something will happen. Roll the indicated amount of **d6** if any of the dice is 1, that thing happens.

## Attribute Tests & Checks

Rolling dice in Dead Weight is a dangerous and strategic activity, in general players want to get away with actions that do **not** involve testing. Testing is usually  **exhausting** for the characters, and in the dungeons, fatigue is deadlier than most blades. The **GM** may ask you to perform a test when you try to perform a test when your character tries to do something something difficult, uncertain and with consequences.

Rolling dice also involves decision making, carefully choosing which dice to reroll is an important part of the game and help your character to take difficult actions with different approaches.

Testing is always done in relation to a character's attribute, for example, trying to break down a door would require a **test of *strength***. To do so players must roll up to the same amount of dice of the value of the tested attribute. A character with ***strength value*** of 3 would have 3 ***available dices*** for a ***strength test***.

The player needs to roll a **4, 5 or 6** in at least one dice to complete the task successfully. If the player rolls more than one **6** on the dice, that's an great success and things go exceptionally well for that character. On the other side, if the player fails and rolls one or more **1** on the dice, that's a critical failure and things go exceptionally bad for that character.

Beware that if **any** of the rolled dice is **4** or **1** the player will receive one fatigue point to that attribute, and only one, even if the test succeeded.

Rerolling dice is a common thing in **Dead Weight** many things, like character skills and dangerous situations will allow the *players* and the *GM* to reroll certain dice. The order of rerolls is always dynamic, *players* may choose to use their rerolls one by one, react to the *GM* rerolls and vice-versa. **The test is only evaluated when both sides can't or agree not to reroll any more dice.**

<pagebreak>

Here is an example of an attribute test:

>Amber wants to climb down a rope, so the GM says that she will require a ***dexterity test***. She has 4 points of ***dexterity***, so she decides to roll all 4 dice.
She rolls **1, 2, 4 and 6**. 4 and 6 gives her ***2 hits***, meaning a success then she manages to climb down the rope safely. Unfortunately for Amber, she also rolled a 1 and a 4, since that happened she should receive one ***fatigue point*** to her ***dexterity***.

If you are really into statistics, you can check the chance of critical failure, failure, success and great success [here](https://anydice.com/program/21d88) and the chance of fatigue [here](https://anydice.com/program/21e52).

### Wounds and fatigue

Every time a character receives a **fatigue** point apply it to an attribute.

Each **fatigue** or **wound** point that the character has on that attribute reduces the **available dices** of that attribute by one.

If a character needs to receive a **fatigue** point and that would make the **available dices** of that attribute lower than zero convert convert one *fatigue* into a **wound** to that attribute, that **wound** can **not** be reduced. Read *Receiving Wounds* for more information.


### Proficiency

Players may reroll a number of dice if they have proficiency on that **attribute**. For example a character with 2 points in **intelligence** **proficiency** can reroll 2 dice when testing for **intelligence**. Players may choose to use their proficiency dice one at the time.

If you choose to reroll a dice you **must** use the new result, even if it's worse in any way.

### Keeping it Safe

If the player doesn't want to risk fatigue they can roll **2 dice less** than their current **attribute value**. Rolling 1 or 4 will no longer exhaust the attribute, unless the test fails. This must be announced before the dice are rolled. You cannot use extra effort when you are keeping it safe.

![](images/helper.png "hand grabbing someone else's arm"){.left}

### Receiving Help

Characters can help each other with a task, if they choose to do so. The player must explain how their character is helping the other in a way that makes sense for the action. The **GM** and the rest of the table must agree that the situation is plausible. This must be announced before the dice are rolled.

A character can only receive the help from one other character, unless the **GM** specifies otherwise. The helping character should roll one dice, that dice will contribute the main roll. If the helping character has a **proficiency** on that attribute they can use it to reroll that dice, but the character performing the main roll may not use proficiency on that dice.

Note that any **fatigue** generated by that dice should be received by the helping character only.

Negative consequences of a failed task are also suffered by the helping character, where applicable, but not the **fatigue** rolled by the main character.

### Extra Effort

If the player really wants to succeed it is possible to add one more dice to the ***available dices*** pool by causing the character one **fatigue** point before the roll, as long the player announces that **before** rolling the dice. A character cannot spend **fatigue** if it would cause the character to receive a wound as consequence of doing so.

Players may use extra effort after rolling the dice.

<pagebreak>

If the player is already going for the **extra effort** rolling 1 and 4 will not cause **fatigue**, since it's already receiving that point.

Helping characters can also use the ***extra effort*** rule, rolling two dice instead of one, as long as they announce that before rolling.

### Lessons Learned

Every time a test fails the player can mark one of the circles below the attribute. When in the **interlude** that character can use those points to level up that attribute. Read more about it on the **interlude**.

### Zero Dice?

If you for any reason need to roll zero dice, you roll 2 dice instead and keep the lowest value. Rolling less than zero dice is also possible, just keep adding dice, to roll -2 dice just roll 4 dice and choose the worst. I'm pretty sure that test will fail, though, sorry.

### Checks or Tests

Sometimes a rule will call for a **check**, such as an initiative check. Checks  work exactly like tests, except that rolling 1s and 4s on this test do **not** cause fatigue.

Proficiency can be used both in **tests** and **checks**.

### Advantage and Disadvantage

When a test describes a especially easy or hard action the **GM** may give players an **advantage** or **disadvantage**. Many combat actions, and enemy abilities will also add an **advantage** or **disadvantage** to tests.

- **Advantage** allows the player to choose **one** dice from the test or check to reroll. The new value must be used.
- **Disadvantage** allows the *GM* to choose **one** dice from the test or check to reroll. The *GM* chooses to use old or new value.

The players or *GM* may always choose *not* to reroll a dice for advantage or disadvantage respectively.

**Advantage** and **disadvantage** will nullify each other if for any reason a test would have both, they also can stack, having **advantage** or **disadvantage** multiple times will allow the players or *GM* to reroll multiple dice.

The *GM* must announce that the test has **advantage** and **disadvantage** before the dice have been rolled.

## Receiving Wounds

Characters will often receive wounds from various sources. Most wounds can be reduced, usually by **armor**. Wounds received by **fatigue** cannot be reduced.

### Armor {.unlisted}

Roll one dice per **armor point**, for each **4, 5, 6** reduce the damage by one. If you roll any **1** or **4** that armor is damage and will lose 1 armor point until it's repaired. Players may always choose to not roll armor dice.

>Zael just received  **2 wounds** from an arrow and decides to use his **reinforced leather armor(2 armor points)** to 2 dice. The new results are 1 and 6, which reduces the damage to only **1 wound**, but the armor is damaged and now has only 1 armor point.

### Placing wounds {.unlisted}

When receiving **wounds** you must choose one or more attributes to place them. If that attribute already have **fatigue** points, you convert those to wounds when placing each point. All wounds must be assigned to the same attribute.

Sometimes a rule will force the player to place the wounds in a specific attribute. If the specified attribute can't hold that many wounds, ignore the excess and the character will immediately collapse and faint.

>Zael now just received **3 wounds** from an sword and managed to reduce it to **2 wounds** using **armor**. After some consideration he decides to that that damage to the **presence** attribute.

Attributes can't hold more wounds than their **score**. If there is no attribute that can hold all the **wounds** fit as many as you can and that **player character** gets **mortally wounded**. Most wounds are considered **lethal**, but sometimes a character will receive a **non-lethal wound**. When that happens a character will not be mortally wounded when receiving that damage, all excess points will just be discarded.


**Mortally wounded characters** don’t die immediately, they cannot take any actions and must be **stabilized** by someone after the combat. If a mortally wounded character receives any more damage that character will die.

**Enemies** don't have attributes, so there's no need to choose where to place the wounds when receiving them. Enemies die when receive more wounds than noted in their enemy sheet.

If the received wounds is reduced to zero or less by armor or other resistances, that character doesn't take any wounds.

<pagebreak>

## Inventory
Characters can carry 3 items + 2 items for each point you have in **strength**. Items should be placed in your character sheet in the appropriate slots in the **Trappings** section. While carrying more items is possible the character will be **encumbered**, all movement is reduced by half and must perform a **strength test** every turn, failing means they drop something.

On top of each list there's a description of what that list is, like "**Belt/Small pouch**". Circle the one you have on your character, if you don't have any of those, just make a big X on the whole list.

Here's a breakdown of how the **adventurers** can carry their items.

- A **bag** carried on the back can carry **4 items**, a **backpack** can carry **7 items**.
- A **belt** can carry **1 item**, a **small pouch** can carry **2 items**.
- A **canteen** can carry **1 liquid item**, a **skin** can carry **2 liquid items**.
- Each **small bag** can carry **3 items**.

Unless stated otherwise characters start with with a **belt**, **canteen** and a **bag**.

## Movement & Distance
Most weapons, skills, spells and items will have a maximum or minimum range to work, to make things simple we can use **abstract distances** instead of exact measurements.
There are 4 range bands for measuring distance in **Dead Weight**:

**Close**, **Nearby**, **Far** and **Distant**.

While it's not usually it's not necessary to know the exact distance of a character to another, here's a handy chart to convert from our system to other systems.

| Distance    |    Meters     |  Squares   |
| :---------- | :-----------: | :--------: |
| **Close**   |     1.5m      |  1 square  |
| **Nearby**  |     7.5m      | 5 squares  |
| **Far**     |      20m      | 12 squares |
| **Distant** | more than 20m | 12 squares |

# The Character

## Attributes

Character attributes in **Dead Weight** specify how good your character is at something.

Attributes have two numbers, the ***value***, that measure your character endurance and natural talent with that attribute and the ***proficiency***, measuring how well trained your character is at that. Every character has 4 attributes.

- **Strength** (STR) is physical strength and constitution of a character. It also influences how many ***items*** a character can carry and your resistance to physical damage.
- **Dexterity** (DEX) is how fast and precise a character is. It is used mostly in ranged attacks, initiative, dodging and in a variety of tests.
- **Intelligence** (INT) is how intelligent and wise a character is. It also influences how many ***spells and prayers*** a character can memorize.
- **Presence** (PRE) is how persuasive and strong-willed a character is. It also influences the party's **morale**.
  
## Skills

Skills mainly give your character extra abilities to use during the **expedition** and **interlude**. But they can also be extremely valuable for gathering information and interacting with the world. With the *loremaster* skill, for example  the *GM* may give you extra information on the dungeon history, or with the *ritualist* skill the *GM* might tell you how remove a curse you got. Skills are a good opportunity for the **GM** and **players** to exercise their creativity well coming up with stories.

Some skills can be upgraded, remove the previous skill before learning the advanced one so it only occupies one slot. They are the ones indented, for clarity. You must always learn the basic skill before the advanced one.

## Trappings
**Adventurers** have a number of item slots in their character sheets, most items take up one slot, some may take more than one and some may be stacked.

When items have a characteristic that makes them awkward or hard to carry, write it bellow the item, with the characteristic occupying one extra slot. Examples of characteristics are **oversized**, **fragile** and **unstable**.

Very small items, like chalk, keys or a dice do not occupy any slots, and should be written down in the *notes* section of the character sheet.

All characters have:

- 4 slots in the **torso**, equipped armor also goes here too.
- 2 slots in each **hand**, equipped weapon or item goes here too. When equipping a weapon or item, the hand may not carry more items. 

Characters may also have certain containers:

- 1 slot in the **belt**, or 2 slots in a **small pouch**.
- 1 slot in the **canteen**, or 2 slots in a **skin**.
- 4 slots in a **bag** or satchel carried on the torso, or 7  in a **backpack**.
- Up to 2 **small bags**, each with 3 **slots**.

You may circle the appropriate container your character has.
