[This is a very very early work in progress, it's playable, but I put it online mostly as a proof of concept and for feedback.]{.alert}

# Welcome

**Dead Weight** takes place in a low-fantasy world, it's very grim and dark but doesn't take itself too seriously. But be advised that **Dead Weight** has strong **horror** elements, and may not be suitable for everyone.

It should be clear that the player characters are no heroes; they are *dead weights*, outcasts and treasure hunters with little to lose. They delve deep into long forsaken places, attempting to save enough silver to leave *Blacksalt Island* for solace and better days elsewhere.

This system has a strong **structure** to it, and focus heavily on dungeon crawling. While exploring the catacombs and dungeons, the characters must struggle with not only the horrors lurking there, but also their fatigue, stress, and the gradual decay of the valuable resources they bring.

The goal of **Dead Weight** is to capture the classic feeling of dungeon crawling tabletop RPGs and board games. It is inspired by many others, borrowing a lot from Blades in the Dark, HeroQuest (the boardgame), The Black Hack and Torchbearer. Don't forget to check our [license](license.html),you are free to hack, copy, change and even sell works derivative from this system, as long you give proper attribution.

This game was designed and illustrated by me, [Pedro Medeiros](http://www.saint11.org) and if you like what I'm doing, you can consider supporting me on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/saint11).


## Blacksalt Island {.unlisted .break}

![](images/weaver.png "a knight dying in a dungeon"){.left}

It's a dreadful place they call **Blacksalt**. A once-great kingdom, **Blacksalt Island** has been ruined by war and plague long, long ago. It was forgotten for many years, but was recently rediscovered. Treasures and arcane relics found in the tombs sparked a "gold rush" of sorts, with people far and wide venturing there to earn some silver.

Now, the island is divided into dungeoneering guilds, each of which owns certain ruins. They allow adventurers to explore them and even assist them with supplies, as long as they receive a cut of any treasure found.

**Blacksalt island** is a gigantic place, with multiple cities on the shore, hastily built for this exploration venture and a few villages on its core. Of the original inhabitants very little is left, but some very small settlements still date back to the time of the old kings.

The ruins are filled with the undead, and the newcomers seem to only add to their numbers. Humanoid creatures also live there, mostly hidden in the shadows and in the forests, like the [child stealing](#the-child-stealers) goblins.

Unlike many fantasy worlds your character is no hero. Quite on the contrary, you are someone at the end of their line. Maybe your days of glory are long gone and mostly likely they never came. In one way or another, you don't have much to lose - and that's what brings most people to **Blacksalt Island**.

You arrived in the island hoping to find something, maybe treasure, maybe some lost artifact, maybe a glorious death.

## What you will need  {.unlisted}

**Dead Weight** is designed with both online and offline play in mind. This rule book has links and a structure optimized for reading online and on mobile, so it's easily accessible to all players. This game is best played with at least 4 players and no more than 6, including the game master.

::: {.web}
If you never played a tabletop RPG before, check [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_v3vTAEML0) video, for a basic explanation.

**For online play you will need:**

- Some voice and text chatting software like [Discord](https://discord.com) or similar.
- A robust online dice rolling software that allows rerolling, like [DeadDice](https://deaddice.page/) a dice rolling app I made just for this system.
- A copy of the character sheet for each player, digital or printed, to the player preference.

**For playing offline you will need:**

- **You can get a print-optimized version of this page too. We provide in two formats [A4](index-a4.html) and [Letter](index-letter.html).**
:::
- Pen and paper for everyone.
- A copy of the character sheet for each player, digital or printed, to the player preference.
- As many 6-sided dices as you can. Ideally 5 per player. Can be played with fewer dice, but it slows down the game.
- Coins, beans, anything that can be used as markers. There are 3 types of markers, **stun**, **shield** and **dodge**.
- Miniatures or some kind of pawns. Each player will require one and the GM will require some for the enemies. They should be easily identifiable.

# The Basics
**Dead Weight** is all about dungeon crawling and delving into dark and terrible places. Let's go over the basics of the system core concepts before anything, after this I recommend that you try to create your first character.

## Game Master {.unlisted}
One of the players is the **game master**, in this book we will also abbreviate that to **GM**. The *GM* is like a narrator and plays with all the non-player characters, guides the outcomes of the player actions and creates the details of the world.

::: {.draft}
The game master has [game master sheet](DeadWeight-master-sheet.pdf), just like the players.
:::

## Players {.unlisted}
Every one else is considered a **player**. Players will each have a **character** they will roleplay, they will choose the actions of that character and try to keep them alive and to move towards that characters *objectives*.

## Adventurers {.unlisted}
**Characters** in **Dead Weight** are people who either lost everything or didn't ever had anything to begin with. Misfits adventurers willing to risk going into the deep vaults of the **Blacksalt Island** to find precious treasures and artifacts while risking their lives and their sanity.

Characters will *level up* between sessions and eventually retire, if everything goes well. Characters can also find an untimely end by something horrible in the depths of the island.

In this book we will often say **adventurers** when referring specifically to the player characters.

## Game Session {.unlisted}

This game played in **sessions**, that can last at least one hour and up to 3 hours, ideally. Each game session is structured in 2 distinct states, the **expedition** and the **interlude**,  which is basically delving into a terrible place or recovering and making plans for the next expedition. The players may choose from a list of actions depending on which phase the game currently is.

## Ok, how do I start? {.unlisted}
First, decide who will be the **game master** and who are going to be the **players**, the game master should ideally read this whole rule book, it is recommended that the players read at least the [Core Mechanics](#core-mechanics) after creating the characters, but it's not required.

Then each player should create a **character**, follow the [Character Creation](#character-creation) chapter for more information.

::: {.draft}
The **GM** should also fill the [game master sheet](DeadWeight-master-sheet.pdf) to set the tone of the world.
In the end of this book there's a sample dungeon to help the **GM** get started. The **players** should **not** read that section.
:::

After that the adventure starts! It is recommended to start on the **expedition**, with the **adventurers** in the dungeon entrance, entering the first room, taking their first action.

<pagebreak>

# Character Creation

![](images/boat.png "A boat in a dark sea"){.left}

Let's start by creating your character, don't worry too much about the rule system for now, just follow the steps from this chapter and choose what you think sounds more exciting. If you really want to know the rules before doing this, you can skip ahead this chapter and come back after you learned the basic rules.

Every character starts the life path with **1 insight point**. **Insight points** can be used to re-roll one or both dice of a life path roll, some life paths will give you more insight. When you complete the last step of your character, you can "move" one attribute score point to another for each insight point you have left.

Each choice will add and remove **attribute points**, **equipment**, and other things to your character. Place them in the appropriate place in your character sheet. 

If you get the same skill twice upgrade it instead. Feel free to jump ahead in to the [skills](#skills), [traits](#special-traits) and [equipment](#equipment) section to understand what they do.

If by the end of your character creation process you have more **items** that you are allowed to carry, choose the ones you want to keep. You can carry **Strength value**x4 + 3 items.

Print a [character sheet](DeadWeight-sheet.pdf) and let's start! Alternatively you can also try the [character generator](chargen.html).

**Adventurers** have 4 main attributes, they are noted in the [character sheet](DeadWeight-sheet.pdf):

- **Strength**(STR) is physical strength and constitution of a character.
- **Dexterity**(DEX) is how fast and precise a character is.
- **Intelligence**(INT) is how intelligent, wise and keen a character is
- **Presence**(PRE) is how persuasive and strong-willed a character is.

Each attribute has 2 values, the **score** and the **proficiency**, the fist one is the natural ability and endurance with that attribute, the other one is how trained the **adventurer** is with that particular field. In the [character sheet](DeadWeight-sheet.pdf), the square area is for the **score** and the circle is for the **proficiency**.

All **attributes scores** start at 1, all **attribute proficiencies** starts at zero.

**Attributes scores** can **not** go lower than 0 or higher than 3 at any point of the character creation, ignore any excess points.

**Attribute proficiencies** can **not** go lower than 0 or higher than 2 at any point of the character creation, ignore any excess points.

# Core mechanics

## Game Structure
A game of **Dead Weight** runs a bit differently then most tabletop RPGs, it follows a strong structure, with two main states.

- [Expedition Phase](#expedition-phase)
- [Interlude](#interlude)

The game usually starts on the **Expedition Phase**, with the adventurers raiding a dungeon or some other terrible place in the **Blacksalt Isle**.

## Dice Notation
Like many tabletop RPGs, **Dead Weight** uses dice notation to specify when and how you should roll your dice. Most of dice roll are common six-sided dice, unless specified otherwise.

When you see **d4**, **d6**, **d8**, **d10**, **d12** and **d20** this is referring to a die of that size, d4 is a four-sized dice and d20 is a twenty-sided dice. 

### Adding dice (2d6) {.unlisted}
And when you see **3d6** means to roll **three six-sided dice** and add the result.

### Usage dice (Ud8) {.unlisted}
Usage dice is a weird but very useful concept. Usage dice are used for tracking how many consumables a character has, like **Trowing Daggers(Ud8)** has a usage dice of a d8. Every time the consumable is used the usage dice should be rolled, if the result is a 1 or 2, that dice is downgraded to the smallest die in the following chain:

**d20 > d12 > d10 > d8 > d6 > d4**

If you roll a 1 or 2 on a **d4** that item is gone, you just used the last one.

### Risk dice (1d!) {.unlisted}
Rolling a risk dice is usually for checking when if something will happen. Roll the indicated amount of **d6** if any of the dice is 1, that thing happens.

## Attribute Tests & Checks

Rolling dice in Dead Weight is a dangerous and strategic activity, in general players want to get away with actions that do **not** involve testing. Testing is usually  **exhausting** for the characters, and in the dungeons, fatigue is deadlier than most blades. The **GM** may ask you to perform a test when you try to perform a test when your character tries to do something something difficult, uncertain and with consequences.

Rolling dice also involves decision making, carefully choosing which dice to reroll is an important part of the game and help your character to take difficult actions with different approaches.

Testing is always done in relation to a character's attribute, for example, trying to break down a door would require a **test of *strength***. To do so players must roll up to the same amount of dice of the value of the tested attribute. A character with ***strength value*** of 3 would have 3 ***available dices*** for a ***strength test***.

The player needs to roll a **4, 5 or 6** in at least one dice to complete the task successfully. If the player rolls more than one **6** on the dice, that's an great success and things go exceptionally well for that character. On the other side, if the player fails and rolls one or more **1** on the dice, that's a critical failure and things go exceptionally bad for that character.

Beware that if **any** of the rolled dice is **4** or **1** the player will receive one fatigue point to that attribute, and only one, even if the test succeeded.

Rerolling dice is a common thing in **Dead Weight** many things, like character skills and dangerous situations will allow the *players* and the *GM* to reroll certain dice. The order of rerolls is always dynamic, *players* may choose to use their rerolls one by one, react to the *GM* rerolls and vice-versa. **The test is only evaluated when both sides can't or agree not to reroll any more dice.**

<pagebreak>

Here is an example of an attribute test:

>Amber wants to climb down a rope, so the GM says that she will require a ***dexterity test***. She has 4 points of ***dexterity***, so she decides to roll all 4 dice.
She rolls **1, 2, 4 and 6**. 4 and 6 gives her ***2 hits***, meaning a success then she manages to climb down the rope safely. Unfortunately for Amber, she also rolled a 1 and a 4, since that happened she should receive one ***fatigue point*** to her ***dexterity***.

If you are really into statistics, you can check the chance of critical failure, failure, success and great success [here](https://anydice.com/program/21d88) and the chance of fatigue [here](https://anydice.com/program/21e52).

### Wounds and fatigue

Every time a character receives a **fatigue** point apply it to an attribute.

Each **fatigue** or **wound** point that the character has on that attribute reduces the **available dices** of that attribute by one.

If a character needs to receive a **fatigue** point and that would make the **available dices** of that attribute lower than zero convert receive a **wound** to that attribute, that **wound** can **not** be reduced by armor or by **toughening up**. Read *Receiving Wounds* for more information.


### Proficiency

Players may reroll a number of dice if they have proficiency on that **attribute**. For example a character with 2 points in **intelligence** **proficiency** can reroll 2 dice when testing for **intelligence**. Players may choose to use their proficiency dice one at the time.

If you choose to reroll a dice you **must** use the new result, even if it's worse in any way.

### Keeping it Safe

If the player doesn't want to risk fatigue they can roll less dice than their current **attribute value** and rolling 1 or 4 will no longer exhaust the attribute, unless the test fails. This must be announced before the dice are rolled.

![](images/helper.png "hand grabbing someone else's arm"){.left}

### Receiving Help

Characters can help each other with a task, if they choose to do so. The player must explain how their character is helping the other in a way that makes sense for the action. The **GM** and the rest of the table must agree that the situation is plausible. This must be announced before the dice are rolled.

A character can only receive the help from one other character, unless the **GM** specifies otherwise. The helping character should roll one dice, that dice will contribute the main roll. If the helping character has a **proficiency** on that attribute they can use it to reroll that dice, but the character performing the main roll may not use proficiency on that dice.

Note that any **fatigue** generated by that dice should be received by the helping character only.

Negative consequences of a failed task are also suffered by the helping character, where applicable, but not the **fatigue** rolled by the main character.

### Extra Effort

If the player really wants to succeed it is possible to add one more dice to the ***available dices*** pool by causing the character one **fatigue** point before the roll, as long the player announces that **before** rolling the dice. A character cannot spend **fatigue** if it would cause the character to receive a wound as consequence of doing so.

Players may use extra effort after rolling the dice.

<pagebreak>

If the player is already going for the **extra effort** rolling 1 and 4 will not cause **fatigue**, since it's already receiving that point.

Helping characters can also use the ***extra effort*** rule, rolling two dice instead of one, as long as they announce that before rolling.

### Lessons Learned

Every time a test fails the player can mark one of the circles below the attribute. When in the **interlude** that character can use those points to level up that attribute. Read more about it on the **interlude**.

### Zero Dice

If you for any reason need to roll zero dice, you roll 2 dice instead and keep the lowest value. Rolling less than zero dice is an automatic failure.

### Checks or Tests

Sometimes a rule will call for a **check**, such as an initiative check. Checks  work exactly like tests, except that rolling 1s and 4s on this test do **not** cause fatigue.

Proficiency can be used both in **tests** and **checks**.

### Advantage and Disadvantage

When a test describes a especially easy or hard action the **GM** may give players an **advantage** or **disadvantage**. Many combat actions, and enemy abilities will also add an **advantage** or **disadvantage** to tests.

- **Advantage** allows the player to choose **one** dice from the test or check to reroll. The new value must be used.
- **Disadvantage** allows the *GM* to choose **one** dice from the test or check to reroll. The *GM* chooses to use old or new value.

The players or *GM* may always choose *not* to reroll a dice for advantage or disadvantage respectively.

**Advantage** and **disadvantage** will nullify each other if for any reason a test would have both, they also can stack, having **advantage** or **disadvantage** multiple times will allow the players or *GM* to reroll multiple dice.

The *GM* must announce that the test has **advantage** and **disadvantage** before the dice have been rolled.

## Receiving Wounds

Characters will often receive wounds from various sources. Most wounds can be reduced, first by **armor** then by **toughening up**. Wounds received by **fatigue** cannot be reduced.

### Armor {.unlisted}

Roll one dice per **armor point**, for each **4, 5, 6** reduce the damage by one. If you roll any **1** or **4** that armor is damage and will lose 1 armor point until it's repaired. Players may always choose to not roll armor dice.

>Zael just received  **2 wounds** from an arrow and decides to use his **reinforced leather armor(2 armor points)** to 2 dice. The new results are 1 and 6, which reduces the damage to only **1 wound**, but the armor is damaged and now has only 1 armor point.

### Toughen up! {.unlisted}

After the armor reduces the damage, the attacked character **can** perform a ***strength test*** to try resisting the attack, a success will reduce it by **1 wound** and a **great success** will reduce it by **2 wounds**. Careful though, since this is an strength test it can cause fatigue, and in some cases even more wounds.

>Zael just received **2 wounds** from an arrow but reduced it to **1 wound** with a **reinforced leather armor**. Now he decides to use **toughen up** and roll his **strength** and gets 1, 2 and 6. He immediately suffers one fatigue from that 1, but also gets a success, reducing it to **0 wounds**, leaving nothing but a scratch!


### Placing wounds {.unlisted}

When receiving **wounds** you must choose one or more attributes to place them. If that attribute already have **fatigue** points, you convert those to wounds when placing each point. All wounds must be assigned to the same attribute.

>Zael now just received **3 wounds** from an sword and managed to reduce it to **2 wounds** using **armor** and **toughen up**. After some consideration he decides to that that damage to the **presence** attribute.

Attributes can't hold more wounds than their **score**. If there is no attribute that can hold all the **wounds** fit as many as you can and that **player character** gets **mortally wounded**. Most wounds are considered **lethal**, but sometimes a character will receive a **non-lethal wound**. When that happens a character will not be mortally wounded when receiving that damage, all excess points will just be discarded.

**Mortally wounded characters** don’t die immediately, they cannot take any actions and must be **stabilized** by someone after the combat. If a mortally wounded character receives any more damage that character will die.

**Enemies** don't have attributes, so there's no need to choose where to place the wounds when receiving them. Enemies die when receive more wounds than noted in their enemy sheet.

If the received wounds is reduced to zero or less by armor, toughen up or something else, that character doesn't take any wounds.

<pagebreak>

## Inventory
Characters can carry 3 items + 2 items for each point you have in **strength**. Items should be placed in your character sheet in the appropriate slots in the **Trappings** section.

On top of each list there's a description of what that list is, like **Belt/Small pouch**. Circle the one you have on your character, if you don't have any of those, just make a big X on the whole list.

Here's a breakdown of how the **adventurers** can carry their items.

- A **bag** carried on the back can carry **4 items**, a **backpack** can carry **7 items**.
- A **belt** can carry **1 item**, a **small pouch** can carry **2 items**.
- A **canteen** can carry **1 liquid item**, a **skin** can carry **2 liquid items**.
- Each **small bag** can carry **3 items**.

## Movement & Distance
Most weapons, skills, spells and items will have a maximum or minimum range to work, to make things simple we can use **abstract distances** instead of exact measurements.
There are 4 range bands for measuring distance in **Dead Weight**:

**Close**, **Nearby**, **Faraway** and **Distant**.

While it's not usually it's not necessary to know the exact distance of a character to another, here's a handy chart to convert from our system to other systems.

| Distance    |    Meters     |  Squares   |
| :---------- | :-----------: | :--------: |
| **Close**   |     1.5m      |  1 square  |
| **Nearby**  |      10m      | 6 squares  |
| **Faraway** |      20m      | 12 squares |
| **Distant** | more than 20m | 12 squares |

# The Character

## Attributes

Character attributes in **Dead Weight** specify how good your character is at something.

Attributes have two numbers, the ***value***, that measure your character endurance and natural talent with that attribute and the ***proficiency***, measuring how well trained your character is at that. Every character has 4 attributes.

- **Strength** is physical strength and constitution of a character. It also influences how many ***items*** a character can carry and your resistance to physical damage.
- **Dexterity** is how fast and precise a character is. It is used mostly in ranged attacks, initiative, dodging and in a variety of tests.
- **Intelligence** is how intelligent and wise a character is. It also influences how many ***spells and prayers*** a character can memorize.
- **Presence** is how persuasive and strong-willed a character is. It also influences the party's **morale**.
  
## Skills

A character can only have as many skill points as their **Intelligence value** + 2. When learning skills for any reason, if there's no space to fit more skills, you can always choose to forget one.

Many skills give you proficiency when rolling for certain tests. Treat this as you had one or more extra proficiency point on that roll, depending on the skill.

Some skills can be upgraded, remove the previous skill before learning the advanced one so it only occupies one slot. They are the ones indented and require the previous one to be learned before it.

<pagebreak>

## Spells {.wide}
Wizards require a **conductor** to perform their spells, usually a wand, staff or crystal ball. Conductors help them to channel the magic from the *void plane* to the real world. While casting a spell without a conductor is possible, it's extremely dangerous.

When the expedition starts the player must choose a which spells the adventurer will have memorized. For each **intelligence** point, one spell can be memorized.

Casting a spell is always guaranteed to work, after the spell effects are resolved the **player** must do an **intelligence** test:

- On a **success** nothing else happens, the spell was cast as intended.
- On a **failure** the caster forgets the spell.
- On a **critical failure** roll from the spell mishap table adding the spell level to the dice.
- On a **great success** you tap into an arcane well. Your next spell will be an automatic success.

| 2d6 + Spell Level | Effect                                                                                                 |

## Prayers
Clerics require a **holy symbol** to cast a prayer, that symbol depends on the god that the cleric follows. Casting a prayer without a holy symbol doesn't work, but they are usually easy to improvise.

When the expedition starts the player must choose a which prayers the adventurer will have memorized. For each **presence** point, one prayer can be memorized. Each prayer may only be used **once** until the adventurer **rests** at camp, once a prayer is used it is considered **exhausted**. Once per expedition, the cleric may do a **desperate plea** and use on exhausted prayer once.

Casting a prayer is not guaranteed to always work, since the gods can be cruel sometimes. Make a **presence test** when your adventurer tries to cast **prayer**:

- On a **success** the prayer is answered, resolve the effects as usual.
- On a **failure** the prayer is ignored, don't do anything. Ignored prayers do not exhaust them.
- On a **critical failure** you have angered your god, it won't answer any prayers until you make a **sacrifice**.
- On a **great success** you also receive a miracle, roll from the **miracle table**.

# Expedition

![](images/barbarian-torch.png)

During the **expedition** the characters venture into the depths of the earth in search of some reward. Raiding in caves and dungeons is not a healthy job, it takes a toll on the player characters. Time passes in a weird way down there, minutes turns into hours, and hunger and thirst are even more deadly than the monsters inside.

The **expedition** can be broken down in 3 phases:

- [Exploration](#exploration) when moving between rooms, looking for treasure and solving mysteries.
- [Combat](#combat) when encountering enemies and resolving conflict.
- [Camp](#camp) when resting and tending wounds.

The **story** will always be in one of those phases, during each phase the players can choose specific actions.

## Exploration

During the exploration characters can move to another place in the dungeon, fix their equipment, interact with their environment and other various things, but every time a player attempts an action in the dungeon a turn passes. Turns here are a valuable resource that the players must carefully use as a group, since every time a turn passes, different trackers in the *GMs sheet* advance, and they usually cause problems for the **adventurers**.

Any action any player chooses will spend one or more turns. It doesn't matter which player does the action or if the action is done as a group, the turn is spent anyway. Players should avoid splitting up for that reason, if they are divided, they will spend much more turns. Turns during exploration are **not only a measure of time**, they measure the **stress**, **fatigue** and the **general energy** used by the characters.

One of the main reason that the **players** shouldn't to waste turns is the **decay tracker**. Every turn the **decay tracker** should advance, meaning that every 5 turns of exploration all player characters roll from the decay table.

<div class="break"></div>

| Roll(2d6) | Effect                          |
| :-------: | :------------------------------ |
|     2     | Press on (No effect)            |
|     3     | Fatigue                         |
|     4     | Terrified                       |
|     5     | Sleepy                          |
|     6     | Parched                         |
|     7     | Advance the doom tracker        |
|     8     | Hungry                          |
|     9     | Hopeless                        |
|    10     | Angry                           |
|    11     | Wound (player choosen location) |
|    12     | Equipment breaks/lost           |
[Decay]

If a character would receive an affliction that they already have roll again, the player may choose an affliction, including the ones not on this list.

### Omens and Doom

The adventure should have a **dungeon tracker** and a **doom tracker**, which are basically counters. Normally, only the **GM** has access to those trackers.

The adventure should have a list of things that happen when the **doom** or **omens** trackers reaches certain numbers, but they always involve something bad. Raiding dungeons and abandoned places wakes up things better left untouched and reaching the maximum value of the doom tracker means certain death.

The **doom tracker** represents the **adventurers** meddling in the dungeon, making noise and awaking whatever lies inside. Advancing the doom tracker too much usually results in monsters appearing, rooms collapsing and traps being triggered. The last step on the doom tracker usually involves a very hard fight. The doom tracker is bound to a location, if the adventurers go to a new place, a new tracker should be started, if they re-visit a location, use that location's old tracker.

The **omens tracker** is about the state of the party itself. The omens tracker has 2d6 steps, every time the omens tracker fills up, roll from the omens table and make a new one, rolling for the size again. Changing locations do not reset the omens tracker. If the party can't fulfill the omen effect completely, discard/break as many items as possible and **one** and only one more time.

|  1d6  | Effect                                                     |
| :---: | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
|   2   | The party chooses 1d4 equipped items, they are broken now. |
|   3   | The rolls from the decay table, twice.                     |
|   1   | The party must discard d4 units of water.                  |
|   4   | The party must discard d4 rations.                         |
|   5   | The party must discard d4 torches.                         |
|   6   | The party must discard one magical item or magical scroll. |
[Omens]

### Exploration Actions 

#### Move (1 turn) {.block}
Move to a different location, usually to a different room in the dungeon. The *GM* can ask the players to spend more than one turn if the distances are big enough.
Moving often lead to combat encounters.

#### Loot (1 turn) {.block}
Looting a location does not require a test, the *GM* just lists what they find in that location and the **adventurers** can choose what to pick up. Looting can only be used on a safe location, with no enemies or traps. If the players want to try something riskier, it's a freeform action, and may require a test.

If the location has a trap, the **adventurers** may fall for it.

#### Parley (1 turn) {.block}
When you find someone in the dungeon it's usually trouble, but players might try to defuse the situation with a more diplomatic approach. The *GM* play the role of the *NPCs* and the players should play the role of their characters.

If the things get heated the *GM* may require a **presence** test to keep the dialog from scaling to combat.

If trying to lie, deceive or fool someone, a **presence** test may be required.

#### Start Combat (1 turn)  {.block}
Most things in the dungeon want to kill the adventurers, a combat starts if the adventurers start attacking someone or if they are attacked by someone.

If the players have the upper hand and the other side is unaware of their presence, they don't need to roll the initiative test, and are all considered *fast* during this combat.

The whole combat only counts as one exploration turn.

#### Catch your breath (1 turn)  {.block}
Like in combat, player can stop for a while and catch their breath, restoring up to one point of **fatigue** for each attribute. Players may also chose to use any items tagged as *quick* too, such as bandages, light torches and drink water.

#### Look for traps (1 turn) {.block .break}
Looking for traps requires the **infiltration** skill. The players may perform an **intelligence** test trying to find a trap. On a critical failure they will trigger any traps they find. On a great success they disarm it for free.

Finding a trap allows one player to try to disarm it, it requires a **dexterity** test, failing will trigger the trap.

#### Use an item (1 turn) {.block}
Any item that is tagged as [slow]{.tip} can be used for 1 turn. Items tagged as [camp]{.tip} cannot be used.

#### Cast a spell or prayer (1 turn) {.block}
Choose an available ***spell*** or ***prayer*** and tests the appropriate ***attribute*** specified in the ***spell*** or ***prayer*** description.
Execute that spell effect.

Even if the spell uses 2 actions in combat, it only uses one exploration turn.

#### Freeform (2 turns) {.block}
It allows the adventurers to do pretty much anything they want and require some improvisation of the *GM*. Freeform actions usually involve interacting with the ambient, creative thinking and solving puzzles.

#### Set up Camp {.block}
Sooner or later the **adventurers** will need some proper rest, camping will allow them to recover some wounds and afflictions. **Adventurers** can only camp on safe places without any imminent danger. 

Camping starts the [camp](#camp) phase.

#### Take a free action (free) {.block}
Some actions will not trigger a turn.

- Players may rearrange their adventurer's equipment, equipping and un-equipping items.
- Adventurers may use any item tagged as [quick]{.tip}.
- Snuffing out torches or other equally simple action.
- Talk to each other.

#### Exit the expedition {.block}
If the **adventurers** are near an exit and there is nothing blocking their path, they can choose to leave the expedition and return to the [interlude](#interlude)

<pagebreak>

## Combat {.big}

Fighting monstrous things in the dark is terribly costly and dangerous for the adventures. Ideally players should be afraid of fighting and try to avoid all the fights they can, but more often than not fighting can't be avoided.

The combat mode starts when a character attacks another. It is played in **turns**, the order of character is decided on the **setup** then the order remains the same, unless something changes during combat.

During combat the decay tracker should **not** be advanced.

The distinct phases of the combat happen on a loop, until the fight is resolved, they are:

- [0. Setup](#setup) (only on the first turn)
- [1. Fast players turn](#fast-players-turn)
- [2. Enemies turn](#enemies-turn)
- [3. Slow players turn](#slow-players-turn)
- [4. Evaluation and cleanup](#evaluation-and-cleanup)


### 0. Setup

When the combat starts the **GM** places the enemies and player tokens on the **battle chart**. The GM also announces if the the advantage point is available.

Players must make a **free** dexterity test, adventurers that pass the test are now considered *fast* and will act before the enemy. Adventurers that fail are considered *slow* and go after the enemy. Be aware that some enemies abilities may change influence that.

The **GM** separates 2 d6 for tracking morale, one for the enemies and one for the **adventurers**, that's the **morale tracker**.

To determine the adventurer's morale:

- Add one point for each player with at least 1 available presence.
- Add one point for each player with at least 3 available presence;

Enemies start at 1 + the number of enemies. The morale tracker cannot go higher than 6. Some player and enemy abilities may affect the initial state of the **morale tracker**.

Check the [morale](#morale) section for more information on how morale works.

### 1. Fast players turn

Here adventurers that were considered *fast* can act in the order that they want. Each one taking 2 actions. Some adventurers may have special rules that allow more actions or limit those actions. Check the [combat action](#combat-actions) list for which actions an adventurer can take.

### 2. Enemies turn

The **GM** now takes charge of acting for the enemies. They can also act in the order the **GM** sees fit and usually have 2 actions, just like the players. Enemies do not take combat actions like the adventurers, they can only **move** and perform one of the **enemy actions** described in their **enemy sheet**.

Enemies also do not roll to hit, but instead players roll a **check** to dodge. This keeps the most combat decisions on the hands of the players. Check the [enemies](#enemies-in-the-dark) section for more information on how enemies work.

### 3. Slow players turn

Here adventurers that were considered *slow* can act in the order that they want. Each one taking 2 actions. Some adventurers may have special rules that allow more actions or limit those actions. Check the [combat action](#combat-actions) list for which actions an adventurer can take.

### 4. Evaluation and cleanup

Remove any unused **dodge markers** from all characters. **shield makers** stay in place.

The GM now check the morale tracker, if any side is **broken**, meaning it went lower than  1, the combat now ends with them surrendering. If the other side doesn't accept, the combat continues. If both sides are **broken** the combat also ends, with both sides retreating.

If the combat continues, go to [fast players turn](#fast-players-turn) again resuming the combat loop.

### Morale
The **morale tracker** is created during the [setup](#setup) phase and tacks which side is confident in a combat.

Every time a character dies or gets mortally wounded, remove one morale point from that team. Some abilities may influence the **morale tracker** without mortally wounding characters. Anytime a player character's presence available dice reaches zero, also remove one morale point from that team.

If of the dice should be reduced to lower than 1 that side is considered **broken**, the GM can put that dice away and it cannot be recovered during this combat.

When the **adventurers** are **broken**, all defense **checks** and attack **tests** are done with a [disadvantage]{.tip}. When the enemies team are broken, all defense **checks** and attack **tests** are done with a **advantage**. A broken team will usually flee the combat to recover.

<pagebreak>

### Combat Actions

This is a list of the common combat actions a character can take. Many special abilities and traits will either change how this works limit or expand this list. Players can also take *freeform actions* at the **GM** discretion, the cost of those actions is also decided by the **GM**.

If the player has one or more **stunned marker** they can only do a [recover action](#recover-1-action) until there are no more markers left.

#### Attack (1 action) {.block}
Choose a weapon and a target. Read the weapon description for any special rules.                                              
Test the weapon **attribute** to hit.                                                                                         
For each ***dodge*** and ***shield marker*** the defender spends, they may choose a dice and force the attacker to reroll it. 
On success apply the **wounds** specified in the weapon                                                                       
On a great success, add the **critical wounds** too.

Weapons can only attack units within their range, if a weapon description doesn't specify  a range it can only hit targets **Close**.

Check the [taking damage](#taking-damage) on the enemy section to see how enemies receive and reduce wounds.

#### Recover (1 action) {.block}
You may remove one ***shield marker*** or ***dodge marker***, if you do so, also recover one **fatigue** point from on a chosen attribute. 
You may remove one ***stunned marker*** from the character.

#### Move (1 action) {.block}
Move to a new position by one unit.                                                                               
You can test **dexterity** to move that extra position on a **success** or to anywhere on a **great success**. 
Moving will remove any unused ***shield markers***.                                                               
If the current battle chart has an **advantage point**, the character can move there by using 2 actions.          
The character may change their facing after moving.                                                               

#### Catch breath (1 action) {.block .break}
Recover one **fatigue** point for each **attribute**. 

#### Defend (1 action) {.block}
Requires a shield or something that can be used as a shield. 
Place a ***shield marker*** on your character.
Characters can't have more than 5 shield markers at any time.

#### Dodge (2 actions) {.block}
Make a dexterity test, place one ***dodge marker*** on a success. 
Add another one on a **great success** on your character.      

#### Cast spell or invoke a prayer (1 or 2 actions) {.block}
Choose an available ***spell*** or ***prayer*** and tests the appropriate ***attribute*** specified in the ***spell*** or ***prayer*** description.
Execute that spell effect.                                                                                                                           

#### Use item or change equipment (1 action) {.block}
Equip, use an item for it's effect.
If changing equipment remember to return that character's previous equipped item to the inventory.

You can instead give or use an item on someone on the same tile if they have inventory space.
Throwing an item to someone up to two units away is also possible, but requires a **dexterity test** for both characters. 
Receiving an item doesn't cost an action.                                      

#### Help another (2 actions) {.block}
Next turn an ally will receive an extra dice from you in all their actions, can only be used on allies that are on the same or adjacent positions.
Check *Receiving Help* for more information.

<pagebreak>

## Camp {.big}

Delving into dungeons and tombs will often leave the adventurers **wounded** and **exhausted**, pressing on without resting is not possible. Sooner or later the adventurers must slow down, eat, sleep and tend their wounds.

:::{.web}
![](images/fire.png "A fireplace"){.left} 
:::

Camping also is divided in smaller phases:

- Camp setup
- Camp actions
- Ambush
- Break camp

### Camp Setup 
The players objective on the camp setup is to get as many **action points** they can by using their **adventurers**' resources, skills and traits. During the setup the players will decide how this camp will be set.

- Add 1 **actions** if the adventurers are camping in a dry and stable place.
- Add 1 **action** for each *camping supply* item used.
- Add 1 **action** for each **adventurer** with the survivalist skill.
- Add 1 **action** the the **players** decide to make a fire.
- Add 2 **actions** and **advance the doom tracker** if  the players decide to take a long rest.
- Subtract 1 **action** if the location is particularly **filthy** or **unhealthy**. (Cold, flooded, littered with corpses, etc.)

### Camp Actions
With all the actions now accounted for, the group decides on how they should spend their actions.

#### Keep a lookout (1 actions) {.block}
Remove 1 ambush dice.

#### A well deserved rest (1 actions) {.block}
Recover all fatigue points of the whole party.

Removes the **Shaken** affliction.

Unexhaust all **prayers**.

#### Use items (free) {.block .break}
**Adventurers** may use as many items tagged as **Slow** or **Quick** as they want.

#### Use camp items (1 action) {.block .break}
Each **adventurer** can use one item tagged with **Camp** for its effects.

#### Cook some food (1 action) {.block .break}
Cooking, different than other items has an special action, and requires a fire and at least one **camping supplies** to have been used during this camp.

When cooking one ration can feed 2 **adventurers**. If someone has the **cooking** skill one ration can feed 3 **adventurers**.

A regular ration will remove both the **hungry** and **parched** afflictions. Regular rations can also be consumed raw, feeding only one **adventurer**, with the **use item** action.

When using special ration, the ration will not remove the **hungry** affliction, but may cure other affliction instead. Special rations will also remove the **parched** affliction. 

- **Tea** or **hot chocolate** removes teh *angry* affliction.
- **Coffee** removes the *sleepy* affliction.

#### Tend wounds (1 action) {.block}
Requires one **medical supply** for each wound treated. Can only treat one wound for each attribute.

#### Memorize spells and prayers (1 action) {.block}
**Wizards** and **Clerics** may memorize and forget spells and prayers. 

#### Sleep (2 actions) {.block}
Recover all fatigue points of the whole party. Removes the **Sleepy** and **Shaken** afflictions.

Add 1 ambush dice.

### Ambush! {.draft .unlisted}
Camping in a dungeon is always risky. After resolving the actions the *GM* should make an ambush roll. To create a dice poll you should add:

- One dice if the place is particularly exposed.
- One dice if a fire was lit.
- One dice if the party has camped before in this expedition.

Other things can add more dice, like the **sleep** action or events in the **doom tracker**. Removing dice is also possible, like the **keep a lookout** action.

Roll all those dice, if a **6** is rolled a combat happens, if more than one **6** is rolled, the **adventurers** are surprised. Use the **wandering monsters** from the dungeon.

<pagebreak>

### Break Camp 
The **adventurers** snuff out any fire they had going gather their things and press on. Return to the [exploration](#exploration). The GM should advance the **doom tracker** once, if the **adventurers** had a *long rest* the **doom tracker** advances twice.

# Interlude {.draft .unlisted}

## Character Progression

Unlike most RPG systems the character progression is not always for the better. As the characters goes on adventures they can gain experience, gold and better equipment, but they can also lose their sanity, acquire grievous wounds, curses and mortal enemies. Characters can level up to level 6, after that they will eventually find their untimely death or will finally ***retire***.

Retired characters contribute to ***The Guild***, allowing players to start new characters with more bonuses and giving them a long term goal.


# The Game Master {.draft .unlisted}

<pagebreak>

# World

For more information about the locations and history of the island, check the [Blacksalt book](./blacksalt.html).

## Trappings
**Adventurers** have a number of item slots in their character sheets, most items take up one slot, some may take more than one and some may be stacked.

When items have a characteristic that makes them awkward or hard to carry, write it bellow the item, with the characteristic occupying one extra slot. Examples of characteristics are **oversized**, **fragile** and **unstable**.

Very small items, like chalk, keys or a dice do not occupy any slots, and should be written down in the *notes* section of the character sheet.

All characters have:

- 4 slots in the **torso**, equipped armor also goes here too.
- 2 slots in each **hand**, equipped weapon or item goes here too. When equipping a weapon or item, the hand may not carry more items. 

Characters may also have certain containers:

- 1 slot in the **belt**, or 2 slots in a **small pouch**.
- 1 slot in the **canteen**, or 2 slots in a **skin**.
- 4 slots in a **bag** or satchel carried on the torso, or 7  in a **backpack**.
- Up to 2 **small bags**, each with 3 **slots**.

You may circle the appropriate container your character has.

### Equipment

There are 5 item categories **common**, **uncommon**, **valuable**, **rare** and **exotic**. The categories set the item price and how hard is to find it during the **interlude**.

Again, if you really like statistics, this is the statistics map of the [possible prices](https://anydice.com/program/222fe).

<itemTable id="0" caption="Common items (1d6 silver)">

<itemTable id="1" caption="Uncommon items (2 + 2d6 silver)">

<itemTable id="2" caption="Valuable items (3 x 2d6 silver)">

<itemTable id="3" caption="Rare items (5 x 3d6 silver)">

<itemTable id="4" caption="Exotic items (10 x 4d6 silver)">

### Weapons

![](images/weapons.png "Weapons"){.left}

#### Weapon Notation

Weapons are notated as following:

> Falchion (STR 3+1B)

Let's break down the **Falchion** notated above. To use it you test your strength(**STR**), causes 3 wounds on a regular success and 4 wounds(**+1**) on a great success. The last thing is the "**B**", meaning that on a great success it will cause the bleeding afflictions.

Some weapons are even simpler:

> Driftwood Club (STR 2)

This means that just like the falchion, you test **strength** to hit, but always cause 2 wounds, even on a critical hit.

Let's see another example:

> War hammer (STR 1P+3): If you hit roll a d6, on a 6 add a **stun marker** to the enemy.

The **War hammer** also requires a strength(**STR**) test to hit, causes 1 wound on a regular success and **pierces trough armor**(**P**). On a critical hit it causes wounds(**+3**) and still pierces through armor, effects that happens on regular hits also happen on critical hits. Note that the **war hammer** has a special effect to be applied on hit, always check the weapon text before the attack.

There are many possible effects associated with weapons, here is a list of all of them:

| Symbol | Effect                                       |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **S**  | Add a **Stun Marker.**                       |
| **B**  | Causes the **Bleeding** affliction.          |
| **P**  | Pierces through **Armor**.                   |
| **R**  | Can't use **Toughen Up** or be **Resisted**. |
| **D**  | Ignores **dodge tokens**.                    |
| **X**  | Ignores **shield tokens**.                   |
| **?**  | Special effect on the description.           |
[Weapon Effects]

Ranged weapons have the range specified, if nothing is written, just assume it hits only targets that are **Close**. Here's a ranged weapon example:

> Throwing hatchet (DEX 1X+1 **Nearby**)

This throwing hatchet can it a target nearby and ignores shields.

All weapons can be used with one hand, unless stated otherwise.

# Enemies in the Dark

A list of monsters and enemies can be found in the [bestiary book](bestiary.html).

Enemies do not have a complete character sheet, instead they have a simplified one, let's look at an example:

<monster id="freshly_risen_corpse">

Let's break it down. First the name of the enemy, [Freshly Risen Corpse]{.m}, then it's level, this one is **level 2**. The level will help the **GM** to quickly know how powerful this monster is.

Next is the number of wounds this enemy can resist before being knocked out, 4 in this case. After that we can see how many armor points they have, just 1 here. And finally the enemy resistance, which is the value they will use for reducing any number of wounds they receive.

For tracking the enemy's armor and wounds, you can print this [enemy page](MonsterPage.pdf) and fill them as you need it or just use tokens.

## Enemy attacks and actions

Unlike player characters the enemies can't choose from a big pool of actions, they instead have all the actions listed in their sheet. The only action all enemies can always take is [move](#move-1-action) and [recover](#recover-1-action). If an enemy has one or more **stunned  marker** on it, they must use the [recover action](#recover-1-action) until there are no more tokens left.

In our example, the [Freshly Risen Corpse]{.m} can only **move** or try the **Infectious bite** action. Let's review it's attack:

> **Infectious bite** (STR 1+1): Causes **Plagued** on **1d!**.

The notation in  front of the action works almost exactly the same as a [weapon notation](#weapon-notation), the only difference is that the attribute listed is the attribute required to **defend** instead the attribute required to **attack**. If our **Freshly Risen Corpse** enemy tries to bite an adventurer this would require a free **strength** test from the **adventurer** to avoid the attack. The enemies cause critical damage when the player character gets a critical failure on their defense. Like most weapons, enemy attacks usually have a special effect described too.

Some enemy actions will cause a [disadvantage]{.tip} to the attribute check related to them.

> **Eat** (STR-2 3+3): Can only be used on a grabbed character.

This means that the **player**'s **strength** check will have [disadvantage]{.tip} applied **twice**, allowing the *GM* to reroll 2 dice from that roll.

If the player character has one or more **shield marker** or **dodge marker** they can spend them to reroll that many dice of their choosing.

Enemies don't have attributes so they can't make attribute tests, they make an *enemy test*, If an enemy needs to test for anything the **GM** can roll using the monster's **LVL** value, rolling the amount of dice. Although is recommended to avoid making tests  for enemies when possible. Enemies do not take fatigue.

Enemies also do not have **afflictions**, but they can bleed. If they are bleeding roll a d6 on the start of their turn, if they get a failure (1, 2 or 3) they take one wound.

For more information on how fighting works, check the [combat](#combat) section.

## Taking damage

When an enemy takes damage they will always resist wounds using their **armor**. Enemies armor can break and can't be repaired. Check [receiving wounds](#receiving-wounds) for a full explanation on how **armor** works. After the rolling the **armor test** if the enemy has any **resistance** points, reduce the wound by that number.

**Armor** and **resistance** can reduce the damage to 0, but anything less than 0 is ignored.

# Sample Dungeon
Here's a sample dungeon for the players to delve into. **Only the *GM* should read this section**, so it's on a separate page, follow this [link](dungeon/dungeon_level_1.html) to access it.
(I'm still working on the dungeon it's not nearly done)
