## About this level {.unlisted}
The burial chamber is filled with an unnatural darkness, all light sources can light only half the distance (round down, torches only light up to 2 tiles away).

Still working on this... {.alert}

## 1 Chamber Entrance

Stairs come down from the mausoleum to the burial chamber, the steps look ruined and crumble a bit when stepped on. The south wall is adorned with stone skulls and the door is only half the height of a normal door. Written above it *"All that enter must bow in humbleness to death*.

## 2 Twisting Corridors

The dusty corridor twist in strange ways, the walls made of very large rectangular stones. Trails of black blood start and end all over the place, there was a fight here, but there are no corpses.

There's an iron nail, between the floor and the wall right after the entrance.

*There is a secret passage to the [Corpse-Shrinking Lab](#3-corpse-shrinking-lab). The iron nail is keeping the door closed, but after it's removed that section of the wall can be pulled and it will open.*

## 3 Corpse-Shrinking Lab

This room's the lab of Acheron Zul, it's filled with failed experiments. Glass tubes with a glowing green liquid and corpses inside are all over the place.

- When the **adventurer** get in, 4 [shrunken corpses]{.m} attack them. 2 break from their glass tubes, 2 come from under the table.
- The other corpses inside the tubes twitch and look at the **adventurers** when they move around, but are harmless.
- The green liquid is highly toxic, any contact with it will cause one wound, and **nauseated** affliction.

> At some point Acheron Zul tried a popular technique of that time, to dry and shrink the corpses in an effort to make them harmless. It obviously backfired.

## 4 Flooded Tunnel
Continuing south the corridor starts to go down and part of it is flooded up to 1 meter deep. Rusty and leaky pipes can be seen running on the ground.

If the **adventurers** keep going south, they will notice that the corridor walls are crumbling and covered in spider web.

- A [spiderling]{.m} runs back to the [Guhlat's Lair](#7-guhlats-lair) as soon as it sees the **adventurers**.
- A metal rusty door lead to [mining supply room](#8-mining-supply-room).

## 5 Sacrificial Pit Entrance
Many vines have overgrown and the passage to the [sacrificial pit above](,/../dungeon_level_1.html#15-sacrificial-pit). Small bones and dry pieces of animal leather cover the flor.
There are some shackles on the wall.

## 6 Flooded Mine
This room is part of a cave system and ist flooded with water, the ceiling is very high, except for northeast corner, which has a huge depression. That corner has a lot of pipes leading to it and so much water if falling from there that it looks like it's raining inside.

All the walls glimmer with small black rocks from the cave system.

A water pump is here connected to the water source, and it's pumping water upstairs. A valve can be closed, that will drain the water from the [flooded embalming room](./dungeon_level_1.html#flooded-embalming-room) upstairs.

- A [giant crab]{.m} is lurking under the water, it will wait for the **adventurers** to get distracted and get out of the water **very** slowly, unless someone is watching the water it will surprise them.
- The water raining from the ceiling will snuff out any torch. Lanterns are safe.

## 7 Guhlat's Lair

This is the nest of the giant spider known as **Guhlat** by the people of Trinta. Is a big cave, but it is clearly not a natural one, but dug out by the spiders, since it's a bit too rounded. The walls and floors are covered in spider web and are filled with small dried animal carcasses and thousands of very little spiders.

- [Guhlat, the giant spider]{.m #giant_spider} is here.
- 4 [spiderlings]{.m} will protect guhlat, but will run away immediately if she dies.

If the combat is too easy, you can add 1 or 2 [dire spiders]{.m} coming from the outside tunnel.

## 8 Mining Supply Room
This looks like an old supply room for some kind of mining operation.

- A small cart with rocks, if the rocks are searched, a small [valuable]{.tip} precious stone can be found.
- Mining tools, a pickaxe (STR 2P) and a shovel.
- 
- There is a hydraulic machine here, with a valve. Opening the valve will spill some water and a mechanical noise far away can be heard.

## 9 Abandoned Vault
The entrance to this room is hidden, if someone pushes the wall an audible click can be heard and the wall will open.

- There is a hydraulic machine here, with a valve. Opening the valve will spill some water and a mechanical noise far away can be heard.

## 10 Tainted Shrine

A sturdy ornate metal door is at the west, it has no handle. Two pipes are coming out from the door, and down the stairs, one going north and one south, they disappear into the wall.

When both valves in the [abandoned vault](#9-abandoned-vault) and in the [mining supply room](#8-mining-supply-room) are open this door will open, sliding into the floor.

## 11 Summoning Room

## 12 Corpse Storage
Big iron bars and a gate separate this room from the other [summoning room](#11-summoning-room). Here are stored dozen of vases with human corpses inside, all heavily bounded but still moving. If any of those are freed, they will attack anyone near, they are [starved cadavers]{.m}.

The southeast section of this room is partially flooded, and the water is foul, mixed with the corpses fluids.

## 13 Cave Antechamber
The [goblin matriarch]{.m} is locked in here, siting in the corner, her fungus now partially attached to the wall. Two [gremlins]{.m} are carrying pieces of corpses to downstairs and running back up, with a terrified look on their faces.

## 14 Achereon Zul's Vault
Acheron Zul's rotting corpse walking in circle in his sealed vault, with a silver dagger stuck to his back. Most of his clothes have rotten and fallen to the ground and he's mostly naked. The ground has a small depression in the shape of a circle, where he must have walked wall these years.
