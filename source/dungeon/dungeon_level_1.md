Acheron Zul is long gone, but his horrible curse afflicted upon the nearby fief of Trinta. The **adventurers** must now enter his tomb to find his remains, but goblins have raided it first, finding things they weren't expecting.

## General Information {.unlisted}
This is the tomb of a once powerful necromancer, called Acheron Zul, who died horribly during one of his rituals. Goblins raided this tomb to scavenge for magical artifacts but ended up waking up Acheron's curse. Now the goblins and the undead roam the chambers, fighting each other.

The dungeon has 3 levels. The mausoleum (this floor), the [burial chamber](dungeon_level_2.html) and the [primordial cave]().

This adventure is planed to be played in more than one session, with the adventurers going back and forth from the dungeon and to the nearby village, to rest and restock.

This adventure was heavily inspired by many stories by Clark Ashton Smith, specially [The Weaver In the Vault](http://www.eldritchdark.com/writings/short-stories/241/the-weaver-in-the-vault). It's not a direct adaptation by any stretch, but if you read it you will see the references all over. While reading the short story is not required, it will definitely help to understand the mood of this story.

### Hook
Things were already bad at the fief of Trinta, and then the bad omens started happening. Milk turned sour, water became red, tasting iron and chalk, chickens started to eat one another and old people would cough small insects. The lord took action only when his youngest son fell ill.

The lord's soothsayer made it clear, Acheron Zul's curse befell upon the village, and a ritual must be conducted to purge them from that blight. Somebody must venture his tomb, and if there is still a mummy of Acheron Zul, or anything left of him, it must be meticulously fetched and brought to her. 

Possible ideas for starting out:

- The **adventurers** came to Trinta trough a trade caravan they were hired to guard.
- The **adventurers** are under the command of the Lord of Trinta. Going in the tomb might be the safer than confronting him.
- The caravans leaving the village are all halted because of the curse, the horses hoofs are all infected. Solving this might be the only way out.
- The lord is suspicious to the to the adventurers, blaming them for the curse. Finding the corpse for the lord might be safer than trying to run.
- There is a 100 silver coins bounty on the remains of Acheron Zul.

### Rumors
Start by giving each **adventurer** knows a rumor. If an adventurer has 2 or more points in **presence**, they know 2 rumors. Do not repeat rumors between players, roll again on repeats. Ideally this should be passed as a note, so they can speculate between them.

### Dungeon History
> This is some optional history for this dungeon, **if you are in a hurry, feel free to skip this chapter**.
> This information should not be shared directly with the players, this is a guide to the GM, so you will know what's actually going on in this tomb.

As well as being the feudal lord of the fief of Trita, Acheron Zul was a necromancer-priest almost a century ago. As most necromancers-priests of that time, he was desperately trying to stop the [dead vigil],{.tip}. While he started with a good intention, he quickly got obsessed and arranged macabre ceremonies and experiments.

His ever increasing demand for corpses would be satisfied by an old custom of Trinta, every month a sacrifice was made to **Guhlat**, a giant spider that lives on a nearby hill. The spider would leave the Trinta alone as long as she was fed live humans. The peasants would often capture and throw unwary travellers in the [sacrificial pit](#15-sacrificial-pit) for that purpose.

Acheron Zul would then use those the corpses after the spider had sucked them dry, and eventually had a tomb-church built on the spider's hill. There he would perform many experiments, involving demons, undead, anf forgotten religions.

Digging always deeper they found the **primordial cave**, and an ancient temple of a forgotten god. Using the temple, Acheron Zul summoned the **Vault Weavers**, flying demonic spheres that would consume any corpses, leaving no traces behind. The problem was that the weavers presence was highly unnatural, and their feeding would cause terrible effects on Trinta, animals would die, food would spoil and people got horribly sick.

The people of Trinta, scarred, thought that Acheron had cursed them. They invaded the tomb, killing Acheron Zul, sealing him inside. The curse eventually went away as the **Vault Weavers** consumed all the corpses in their chamber and hibernated.

After many years, the curse returned after a group of expelled goblins stumbled upon the tomb and began living there. They accidentally trapped their matriarch inside the weaver's vault. Some of the goblins ran away scared, sealing the place. The ones inside started feeding corpses to the weavers so they would spare their matriarch. The disturbing goblins also woke up other creatures in the tomb, including void demons from previous failed experiments.

The villagers are now sending mercenaries to the tomb, feeding the weavers even more.

### Entrances
The tomb is on top of and old hill, covered in moss, grass and vines.

Adventurers may enter through the obvious [tomb entrance](#1-the-tomb-entrance), through the [secret entrance](#9-secret-entrance) or they can climb down through [the pit](#15-sacrificial-pit). The only obvious entrance is the main one, the **adventurers** must figure out the other entrances based on the rumors.

There's a passage that goes straight to the tomb, bypassing the mausoleum. Halfway through the pit there's a hole, full os spiderweb, it leads straight to [Guhlat's lair]().

### Doom Tracker
Tick a checkbox every time the characters make excessive noise or waste too much time.

- <input type="checkbox" /><input type="checkbox" /> The **Wandering Goblins** show up.
- <input type="checkbox" /><input type="checkbox" /> The ground shakes, something stirs underground. The water on the [embalming room](#5-flooded-embalming-room) is drained. **4 dire spiders** are now wandering the halls.
- <input type="checkbox" /><input type="checkbox" /> All the adventurers feel a ghostly chill, the walls glow a faint light then a sudden wind snuff all the torches and lamps. Many ghosts raise through the floor and exit the ceiling. Everyone is **shaken**.
- <input type="checkbox" /><input type="checkbox" /> The ground shakes and the ceiling starts to fall apart, hitting everyone that doesn't hide under something for (STR 2). Raising a shield should add shield tokens to this check normally.
- <input type="checkbox" /><input type="checkbox" /> **Guhlat**, the [giant spider]{.m} finds the adventurers! During every turn of the combat, a [spiderling]{.m} joins the fight.

### Wandering monsters
Use them when the adventurers wander too much, feel too safe or if things get a bit boring.

- **Wandering Goblins**: They were ordered to roam the tomb looking for intruders. 3 [goblin scrappers]{.m} and 1 [hobgoblin]{.m}
- **Gremlin Crew**: A group of gremlins is scouting the place, looking for tools and trinkets to build traps, 4 [gremlins]{.m}.
- **Guhlat hunting party**: A group of 3 [spiderlings]{.m} is looking for food for their nest. They will avoid fighting if the adventurers give them some meat.


## 1 The Tomb Entrance
The entrance is overgrown with roots from the outside door covering every wall. A strong moldy smell permeate the place. The entrance is barricaded from the inside quite poorly, but there's no way to enter without making a lot of noise.

When dismantling the barricades, a group of 2 [goblin scrappers]{.m} and 1 [hobgoblin]{.m} will come from the door, attacking the adventurers from the back.

## 2 Fountain Room
A murky fountain bubbling with a strange foam.

If the water is disturbed 3 [giant frogs]{.m}. You may skip this fight if the adventurers have encountered too much trouble already.

- Inside the fountain there's the remains of a human hand, with a golden ring (worth 10 silver).

- An **iron door** connects north, it has a small window with a grate.
- A **wooden ornate door** connects west.

## 3 Small Prayer Room
A row of benches, all broken. An amber statue of a saint of [Yulak]{.tip}, barely standing, covered in moss watches over the room. Banners with the symbol of Acheron Zul house decorate the walls.

There are 5 [slumbering corpses]{.m} praying, to the statue, with a low chant. They are distracted and will not attack if not bothered.

- The amber statue is very valuable (80 silver), but extremely heavy and awkward to carry. Requires 2 **adventurers** to carry it with both hands. Breaking the statue will produce 4 pieces of amber, each **Big** and worth 12 silver.
- Behind one of the banners there's a [makeshift tunnel](#makeshift-tunnel).
- In the northwest corner there's a burial cart, for carrying corpses, now empty.

> This is not an easy fight, the **adventurers** probably should avoid this one. It's not impossible to win, just mostly a waste of resources, unless they really want that amber statue.

## 4 Machine Room
A partially flooded and sunk machine room.

An old pump is there, hopelessly broken. A wizard can fix it with the **Machine spirit** spell, though. If fixed it will pump out the water from the [flooded embalming room](#5-flooded-embalming-room) and from the [illustrated vault](#6-illustrated-vault).

Searching this room you may find a **mechanic's toolkit**.

A pile of spikes and red plates with wholes are stacked on the corner. *[This is a clue to a trap in the future.]*

2 goblins are tinkering with the pump and will try to flee as soon as they see the **adventurers**.

## 5 Flooded Embalming Room
The room has a lower part, with some stairs, that part is submerged in water. The whole room is also and partially sunk on the ground, the roof is almost collapsing. The deepest part of the water is 1.5m deep, near the north door.

There's a shelf full of coffins, stacked on the west side of the room.

The room was originally an embalming room, and has many chemical flasks floating on the water. After the first character crosses the water, some flasks may open, causing the water to become toxic, causing **1 intelligence wound** per turn to anyone else that crosses.

- *Maybe the adventurers can improvise a boat with a coffin?*
- Some of the chemicals are actually tonics and properly labelled:
  - **Anti-poison tonic**: Cures **Nausea**.
  - **Tonic of Bravery**: Character can't get **terrified** during this expedition.
  - **Potion of giants**: Restore all strength wounds and fatigue. Ud4 uses. 
  - **Rot** and **Flame** extracts.

## 6 Illustrated Vault
The whole room is flooded with water, around 20cm deep, except for the west side, which is almost 1m deep. This whole room is somewhat tilted and sunk on the ground.

The walls are filled with illustrations telling the story of Acheron Zul, his rise to power from his poor origins.

A 3 [Giant Leeches]{.m} are sucking a corpse on the east wall.

**Upon further inspection:**

- The corpse is from a goblin, sucked dry by the leeches and seems quite recent, he has a **Falchion** and some **Rope**.
- The walls are covered in illustrations, they are in a medieval style with the figures varying in size a lot:
  - **West**: A boy in poverty, begging in the streets, an old man with a staff and carrying books offers help. Some people in green clothes ignore him.
  - **North**: A teenager performing magic, the old man was pointing to some books, he looks worried.
  - **East**: A man on top of a hill killing an old man with a knife, down from the hill villagers look at him terrified, bowing. A few villagers refuse to bow, demons are killing those.
  - **South**: An old man, on a throne. Skeletons in green clothes carry his throne. There is a tower in the back with big door painted on it, there is a villager crying on the tower window. > *The door is a secret passage and will open to room 7*

If the players don't pay too much attention to the door illustration you can mention a scraping noise coming from the south.

## 7 Sealed Sleeping Quarters

Upon entering a [starved cadaver]{.m} that was right behind the door jumps on whomever opened it. If the person didn't open it carefully the ghoul immediately attacks, make the defense check with [disadvantage]{.tip}.

The room is filthy, and has a horrible smell. There are 3 moldy beds in this room and 3 skeletons on the corner. There are 2 tables with drawing and sculpture tools. The door is covered in scratch marks from the inside.

- <input type="checkbox"/><input type="checkbox"/><input type="checkbox"/> Staying in this room for 3 turns will make everyone nauseated.

If the **adventurers** let the door close they will be trapped in there too. The door is made of solid stone, so they will need some serious engineering to escape. If they are stuck but making a lot of noise, eventually the [wandering goblins](#wandering-monsters) will open that door.

- **Ink and paper** are usable.
- A **sharp chisel and hammer** can be useful.
- **Scroll** of **curse removal** is on a drawer.
- Supply room **key** is under one of the beds.
- **Ether** extract

> These were the sleeping quarters for the artists that made the illustrations and statues in the tomb. They where trapped here after their work was done.

## 8 Mosaic Corridor
A long twisting corridor, the walls are covered in vines, *at some points you can barely see what's behind*. There's a mosaic telling a story in the walls. Part of it is flooded (check the map) and the deepest part is almost 1m deep.

- There is a grate to the west, where you can see the [secret entrance](#secret-entrance)'s stairs. The grate is old and can be broken.
- Behind the vines on the wall there's a passage to the [pit](#sacrifice-pit).
- If the players saw the *red tiles and spikes* in the [machine room](machine-room) describe that a couple of floor tiles are red. *[Those are spike traps]* stepping on those will cause 3 wounds.

## 9 Secret Entrance
There's a small mausoleum near the tomb entrance, in the middle of it there's a stone coffin. There's no corpse inside the coffing, though, removing the lid shows a set of stairs, down to the main tomb.

The corridor inside connects to the [mosaic corridor](#mosaic-corridor) trough an old iron grate (that can be broken).

There's a dead goblin on the ground, and 2 [reanimated husks]{.m} feasting on the corpses.

## 10 Tomb of the Inner court
There are many rows of stone coffins, each with a statue lying down on it, representing the person buried there. Most of them are opened, though. Corpses are everywhere all of them hacked into pieces, blood splattered everywhere.

There's a goblin camp there, they look injured and tired. They were not expecting the **adventurers** here, so they act surprised. 2 [goblin scrappers]{.m}, 1 [bloodshot goblin]{.m} and 1 [hobgoblin]{.m}. 2 of the *scrappers* are injured, one with 2 wounds, the other with 1 wound.


- The door to the west is locked, the key is in the [sealed sleeping quarters](#sealed-sleeping-quarters). Breaking it is possible, but it is reinforced, so it won't be easy.
- There's a recent human corpse on the floor. She looks like an undead hunter and was carrying:
  - **Ud6 Spikes**
  - **Ud6 Flasks of holy water**
  - **Crossbow** with **Ud10 bolts**
- The north wall is partially demolished, a **sledgehammer** on the ground.
  - Digging through the rubble is possible to open a passage to the [chapel](#chapel).
- The 4 corpses are all wearing a silvery necklace ( **necklace to bind undead**, 10 silver, 5 corpses), removing it will wake the body which is a [starved cadaver]{.m}.
  - The 2 corpses in the north coffins are missing (*they will be found in the second floor*)

## 11 Chapel
If the adventurers fight in the [inner court tomb](#tomb-of-the-inner-court) the doors are barricaded. They can be broken down or the adventurers can find another way in.

The room is an underground chapel, there are probably hundreds of melted candles everywhere, and an altar to the east. The altar is partially elevated and a huge statue of  is behind the altar. The statue is holding a **red gem**. There's another s

A group of goblins is barricaded here. 2 [boggarts]{.m} and 2 [goblin scrappers]{.m}.

They really don't want to fight and are terrified of whatever is down the tomb. If the **adventurers** tell them it's safe, and their leaders (the goblins on room 10) are dead, they  will gladly leave.

## 12 Stockroom
Piles of melted candle wax, brooms and cleaning supplies are in a corner. There's a big table in the middle with a lot of rotten food piled up. A drawer is in surprisingly good condition in the south wall, full of scrolls and inks.

- **Ud8 candles**
- **Scroll of Detect Evil**
- **Scroll of Flaming Weapon**
- The new shelf is blocking a door to the [cult room](#cult-room).
- **Chains and shackles**
- **Scroll of Purify Food**
- **Smoke** and **Rot** extract

## 13 Burial Chamber Entrance
An ornate hall, in the middle of the room two hooded statues frame a stairway going down. The walls are adorned with wooden details. A small red rug is placed near the east wall.

2 [reanimated husks]{.m} are crawling here, one near the stairs and one near the barricade. From the dark bellow, comes a [void demon]{.m}.

There's a stairway to the [lower levels](dungeon_level_2.html) here, but it's closed with an iron gate.

## 14 Acheron Zul Study Room
A very well kept room, dusty but otherwise intact. The floor has a red carpet, mostly intact. There's a study desk full of books, notes and scrolls. All the walls are covered with dusty tomes with no titles, only numbers on the side, and strange scientific instruments.

- Trying to read the books causes a **fatigue point** and leaves the **adventurer** disoriented for a short while. If they insist they may find out some information.
  - This library contains mostly Acheron Zul journals.
  - Acheron Zul was searching for how to become immortal, another topic he was researching was on how to transmute humans into void demons.
  - The journals have a weak curse, making them very hard to read, reading them for too long will make the **adventurers** **Nauseated**.
- **Acheron Zul Old Grimoire**: Scorched, as someone tried to burn it, some pages are thorn. Has wizard spells:
  - 2 level 1 spells
  - 2 level 2 spells
  - 1 level 3 spell
  - 1 level 4 spell
  - Learning any of the spells in the **Interlude** a **PRE** test, on a fail get a new trauma: **Phobia: Void Demons**
- **Magi Robe** (1 [AP]{.tip}): When casting spells, you may allocate 1 point of fatigue on **intelligence** wound in the robe. The robe recovers during the **Interlude**.

## 15 Sacrificial Pit
A pit, with wooden spikes at the bottom, piles of skeletons and broken bones, from human and animals, litter the place. Some of the bones are moving a bit, because of the [dead vigil]{.tip}, but are harmless. 

- The entrance to the tomb is covered in vines.
- A **sturdy helmet** (1 [AP]{.tip}) is in one of the skeletons.
- The walls of the pit are covered with spider webs at on point. Burning or cutting it somehow will reveal a tunnel to the [lower level](dungeon_level_2.html).

## 16 Cult Room
A secret chapel with scratched drawings covering every inch of the stone wall. Some dark ritual took place here. There is a big circle of long dried blood.

The wall to the south is covered in what appears to be inscribed leather (*it's human*), stretched, like in a tanner shop. Behind the leather is a tunnel passage.

The north wall is barricaded by a big bookshelf.

## 17 Makeshift Tunnel
A damp and dirty tunnel, smells of blood. There's a [Bloated Screamer]{.m} on the way.

- The north exit is blocked from the other side by stretched leather. Connects to the [cult room](#cult-room)
- The south exit is blocked from the other side by a banner. Connects to the [prayer room](#small-prayer-room)
- There's a **pickaxe** and a **shovel** here.
