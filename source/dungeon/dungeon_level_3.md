## 1 Winding Staircase
A curved staircase that goes down to the [goblin barricade](#2-goblin-barricade) and back to the [tomb](./dungeon_level_2.html).

A big stone door is pried open and apparently stuck in the opened position by all the weaver silk. If the silk is burned or removed the door will snap closed, sealing anything inside. To open this door again requires the **knock/lock** spell or someone to operate the mechanism in the [flooded mine](./dungeon_level_2.html#6-flooded-mine) above.

## 2 Goblin Barricade
Everything in this room is covered in a silky substance, similar to a spider web but with a different pattern, looking up close, this silk has a fractal pattern.

There's an altar in the middle with a low-relief carving in the shape of a body, empty.

A big barricade was built on the south door here made of spears, table legs, and other improvised materials. There's a small hole in the barricade, not enough for the big weavers in the next room to go trough, but enough for a person. The **adventurers** can see the hungry **weavers** on the other side.

1 [vault weaver]{.m} is here, smaller than the others, this one got through the hole in the barricade. It is just finishing to absorb a corpse, extending it's silk around the room. All movement inside the room is reduced by 1 tile. The weaver will finish absorbing the corpse in its first combat turn, spending one action to become a [red weaver]{.m}. As soon as it eats the corpse the **adventurers** feel a wave o nausea, and anxiety, as it was emanating from the orb, all **adventurers** should receive a stun marker from that.

**Killing the weaver will make it explode, trowing around all corpses it consumed before.** This weaver have consumed at least 10 corpses, including the corpse of Acheron Zul, who can be recognized by the tattoo on his face, de corpse is remarkably well preserved. 

Returning the corpse to **Trinta** will give the **adventurers** the bounty of 80 silver coins. The soothsayer will perform a very dramatic ritual in the middle of the city with the corpse. The soothsayer will claim that the curse is gone because of his ritual. And a small parade in the honor of the **soothsayer** will be held.

The **adventurers** must either kill all the weavers in the other room, or seal this one. If that doesn't happen the weavers from the next room will eventually break out and start consuming the all the corpses from the dungeon, keeping the curse alive. If that's the case the Lord of Trinta will hang the **soothsayer** for not dealing with the curse.

- Piles of clothes and coffins are scattered around the room. Some valuables can be found:
  - 2 **short swords**.
  - **30 silver coins** can be found scattered in the remains.
  - 2 **backpacks**.
  - 1 **small pouch**.
  - 2 [valuable]{.tip} rings.
  - Ancient sacrificial dagger (STR 2B+2), a [rare]{.tip} weapon that also works as a conduit.
  - **Necklace of wisdom**: Allows the **adventurer** to memorize one extra **prayer**, **miracle** or **manoeuver**. [Exotic]{.tip}.

## 3 Weavers Chamber
Behind the barricade is a big cave. Lots os empty clothes, coffins and loose pieces or armor are scattered around. A huge symbol is drawn on the ground.
2 [tomb weavers] are here. These monsters are probably way too strong for the players to deal with, they should consider just sealing them there. Killing the weavers will also deal with the curse.

A book of prayers to the old god **Gyrrath** is on the ground. *This can be a hook for the next adventure*.
