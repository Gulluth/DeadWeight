## Goblin Barricade
A big barricade was built here made of spears, table legs, and other improvised materials. There's a hole in the barricade. Everything in this room is covered in a silky substance, similar to a spider web but with a different, fractal pattern.

1 [vault weaver]{.m} is here, just finishing to absorb a corpse, trowing it's silk around the room. All movement inside the room is reduced by 3 tiles. The weaver will finish absorbing the corpse in one turn and become a [red weaver]{.m}. As soon as it eats the corpse the **adventurers** feel a wave o nausea, and anxiety, as it was emanating from the orb.

**Killing the weaver will make it explode, trowing around all corpses it consumed before.** This weaver have consumed at least 10 corpses, including the corpse of Acheron Zul, who can be recognized by the tattoo on his face.

Returning the corpse to **Trinta** will give the **adventurers** the bounty of 80 silver coins. The soothsayer will perform a very dramatic ritual in the middle of the city with the corpse. The soothsayer will claim that the curse is gone because of his ritual. And a small parade in the honor of the **soothsayer** will be held.

TODO: Lots of loot from the previous corpses if the adventurers manage to defeat the weavers.

## Weavers Chamber
Behind the barricade is a big cave. Lots os empty clothes, coffins and loose pieces or armor are scattered around. A huge symbol is drawn on the ground. There's an altar in the middle with a low-relief carving in the shape of a body, empty.
2 [tomb weavers] are here. These monsters are probably way too strong for the players to deal with, they should consider just sealing them there.
